We studied the impact of health worker training and STD syndrome packets (containing recommended drugs, condoms, partner notification cards and information leaflets) on the quality of STD case management in primary care clinics in rural South Africa.METHODS: A randomized controlled trial of five matched pairs of clinics compared the intervention with routine syndromic management. Outcomes were measured by simulated patients using standardized scripts, and included the proportion given recommended drugs; correctly case managed (given recommended drugs plus condoms and partner cards); adequately counselled; reporting good staff attitude; and consulted in privacy.RESULTS: At baseline, the quality of STD case management was similarly poor in both groups. Only 36 and 46% of simulated patients visiting intervention and control clinics, respectively, were given recommended drugs. After the intervention, intervention clinics provided better case management than controls: 88 versus 50% (P &lt; 0.01) received recommended drugs; 83 versus 12% (P &lt; 0.005) were correctly case managed; 68 versus 46% (P = 0.06) were adequately counselled; 84 versus 58% experienced good staff attitude (P = 0.07); and 92 versus 86% (P = 0.4) were consulted privately. A syndrome packet cost US$1.50; the incremental cost was US$6.80. The total intervention cost equalled 0.3% of annual district health expenditure.INTERPRETATION: A simple and affordable health service intervention achieved substantial improvements in STD case management. Although this is a critical component of STD control and can reduce HIV transmission, community-level interventions to influence health-seeking behaviour are also needed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11125896"

Countries suffering the highest burden of HBV disease are those most needy of universal vaccination, but are frequently of very low income and resources for health care are scarce. The introduction of HBV vaccination would inevitably stretch these resources further even with support of donor agencies. Thus an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of HBV vaccination is desirable to assist in decision making about resource allocation. We describe here a method for estimating the additional costs of introducing HBV vaccination into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) at a national level. Of fundamental importance is that this method enables costs to be assessed prior to the introduction of vaccination. We illustrate the method using a study carried out at the sub-national level, in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, but which can be expanded countrywide. The method, in brief, involved the use of a number of questionnaires which could be used to estimate the costs associated with the EPI programme from a large sample of the static clinics as well as from central sources. Since unit costs were collected along with the quantities of resources used and estimates of the capacity used for certain facilities (such as refrigerators), the additional cost of introducing HBV vaccine could be estimated largely by extrapolation of the resources used in vaccinating against diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus vaccine (which, similar to HBV vaccine, requires three doses). The estimation of costs is only part of the information required to make decisions on resource allocation, and should be used in association with measures of the burden of disease due to the infection in the community and effectiveness of the control programme at reducing this burden. The prediction of the latter, based upon a sound epidemiological understanding of the infection, is the subject of a forthcoming paper.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11124244"

Each year about 2,500 clinical cases are recorded in the country, mainly in pure-bred animals. An attempt was made in the North of Tunisia to estimate the direct cost related to clinical cases of TT. In the endemic regions, three states of endemicity were described according to cattle age categories at highest disease risk: (i) endemic stability, (ii) low endemic instability, (iii) high endemic instability. The characterisation of these endemic situations, which are conditioned by the levels of the vector tick population and the quantitative aspects of the infection in ticks, are highly relevant for the development of a live attenuated cell line vaccine against TT targeting the cattle population at disease risk in Tunisia. A research programme was set up to develop the attenuation of four local parasite stocks. Two cell lines infected with two distinct T. annulata stocks were tested in the field on pure-bred animals of different age groups from regions with high disease incidence. The vaccination with each of the two cell lines showed a high efficacy. However significant differences in vaccine reactions rates were observed between the two attenuated cell lines emphasising the importance of achieving an optimal balance between protection and vaccine tolerance particularly in pure-bred lactating cows.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11071539"

The intricate relationship between the virus and HIV-related human multisystem pathology prompted scientists to modify many previously established concepts about infectious diseases and immunology, and to test new ones. The results of this work helped resolve many, albeit not all, long-standing problems concerning HIV-1 immune escape, its cellular tropism, and pathogenesis of HIV-related immunosuppression and nervous system disease. The most impressive advances have been made in antiretroviral drug treatment of HIV infection, which has resulted in dramatically reducing AIDS-related mortality, morbidity, and perinatal transmission. However, considering the magnitude of the worldwide HIV-AIDS pandemic, prohibitive cost and unusually exacting nature of combination drug treatment, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant HIV mutants, the disease and virus remain formidable and unpredictable, particularly in the area of prevention and vaccine development.

Eight trained Soweto community health workers centered at Chiawelo Clinic and providing home based and neighbourhood health care undertake supervised Tuberculosis treatment, tracing of immunisation defaulters, and health education based on GOBI FFF (Grant JP, UNICEF:1985;94) and &quot;Facts for Life&quot; (UNICEF 1989-1993). They form a link between the community and government health care services and also other available resources. Over a period of 26 months, working from their own homes, they provided 14,254 health related services and in addition undertook 14,501 neighbourhood home visits. They were responsible for 8,710 referrals to the clinic or other relevant agencies for assistance. Incremental training has included HIV/AIDS counselling, advice on family planning with regular report back sessions and discussions. Participatory management involves all major role players. The community health workers have the approval and support of the Local Soweto Health Authority, the Civic Association and the communities they serve. On completion of the project, all were redeployed into local health service posts where it is intended that they form the nucleus of an expanding service. Delegation of selected tasks allows for cost effective functioning of more highly trained staff, an improved service and better use of available resources.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11040587"

Parental interviews, otoscopy, pure-tone audiometric screening (frequency 0.5-4 kHz) and tympanometric examinations were conducted for a representative sample of 359 school children in an inner city area of Lagos. The prevalence of hearing loss was 13.9%. Middle ear abnormalities were noted in 20.9% of the study population, of which 18.7% were reported with otitis media with effusion. Impacted cerumen, documented in 189 children (52.6%), was the most common disorder. It showed significant association with hearing loss (P&lt;0.001) and school performance (P&lt;0.01). Tympanic membrane abnormalities were observed in 144 (40.1%) children. Of these, 45 (31.3%) showed abnormal tympanograms while 28 (19.4%) reported hearing loss (P&lt;0.05). The early detection and management of hearing problems is relatively rare, thus precluding the determination of possible aetiological factors for the observed abnormalities.

Recent studies conclude that mass hepatitis B immunization is effective in preventing HBV infection and has resulted in a decrease in the occurrence of HCC in children living in countries where hepatitis B is endemic. However, the vast majority of infected children live in the poorest developing countries in Africa and Asia that currently cannot afford the vaccine or lack the basic infrastructure necessary to deliver a national immunization service. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) was established in 1999 as an alliance of WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, industry, foundations, and other partners to reinvent immunization for the 21st century, by forging a common vision and new ways of working together at global, regional and national levels. WHO recommends global elimination of hepatitis B by universal infant and/or adolescent immunization, but health planners in Sweden and the other Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and UK have not yet been convinced of the cost-effectiveness of HB-prevention through routine childhood immunization with HB-vaccine. The inclusion of hepatitis B vaccine in already available multivalent vaccines may alter this situation in the future, but until then an intensified vaccination strategy aimed at those groups of individuals that are particularly at risk for hepatitis B should be adopted in accordance with the recommendations of The Swedish National Board of Health (SOSFS 1991:2) and local instructions from the County Medical Officer for Communicable Disease Control.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11016226"

Vaccines against malaria are considered to be the control tool most in need of development. Fundamentally there are three types of malaria vaccines: vaccines against the invading sporozoite or the parasite's development in the liver cells, vaccines directed against the parasite's invasion of and development in the red blood cells; vaccines directed against the fertilisation process in the mosquito. Each malaria vaccine has its own area of application. In spite of promising results in animals it has been difficult to reproduce the results in clinical trials in humans. Recently, however, an experimental vaccine containing a sporozoite protein coupled to a hepatitis B surface molecule with a new adjuvant has been tested in Gambia. The results of these tests are promising, but it is unlikely that the vaccine will be of use in endemic areas. Increased focus on one of the world's biggest health problems has to a certain extent promoted the funding of development work on malaria vaccines. Despite minimal interest from the pharmaceutical industry, a number of experimental vaccines for clinical phase I trials are on their way. However, it will take a huge increase in public financial resources to secure effective and safe malaria vaccines for those most in need of them: people in developing countries and particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10901079"

About 14 studies were analyzed, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for children, chemoprophylaxis or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine, and changing the first line drug for treatment. Results of the analyses demonstrate that highly cost-effective interventions exist for both prevention and treatment; that approaches to improving treatment are likely to be highly cost-effective; and that given the uncertainty and variation involved, the choice between childhood preventive interventions is not clear-cut due to the considerable overlap in their cost-effectiveness ranges. The review also cites several challenges in using cost-effectiveness estimates for policy-making. In conclusion, evidence from economic evaluations can assist policy-makers in identifying interventions representing the best value for money.

As well as screening of blood for transfusion and using sterile needles for injection, preventive measures should be undertaken to reduce the risk of contact (often described as community-acquired infection). Until more is known about the unidentified routes of transmission in tropical and subtropical settings it will be difficult to be specific about the kind of measures which may be effective.

Accurate disease burden estimates for developing countries and Africa in particular, where diagnostic facilities are less adequate and a disease surveillance system virtually non-existent, is difficult. However, from conservative estimates, the pneumococcus is probably responsible for at least 1 million of the 4 million deaths that occur from acute lower respiratory infections in children aged less than 5 years. The global burden of disease has been accentuated by the rising menace of multi-drug resistant strains, which defy geographic and racial borders. Thus, now more than ever before, there is an urgent need to identify and implement preventive measures to avert this problem. The currently licensed pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, comprises 23 capsular polysaccharides of the pneumococcus, many of which are poorly immunogenic in the very vulnerable age group of under-fives. A possible solution to the problem of poor immunogenicity is to use a protein/polysaccharide conjugate vaccine similar to that recently introduced successfully for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and using this approach, several workers have reported promising results from safety and immunogenicity studies. However, unlike Hib, the development of conjugate vaccine against pneumococcal disease is complicated by the existence of more serotypes than can be feasibly incorporated in a single conjugate vaccine formulation. Whilst this challenge has been taken on by some vaccine manufacturers, novel approaches such as the identification or construction of protective protein antigen, common to all clinically important strains are being explored. Novel application of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines in pregnancy for protection of disease in early infancy is an approach that has not been evaluated. For maximum impact, the ultimate vaccine formulation should be affordable and available to resource poor countries where the burden of disease is highest. Establishing disease surveillance systems in such countries now will greatly facilitate the introduction of the vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10708654"

These ratios were highly cost-effective, as defined by the World Bank's proposed threshold of less than US$ 25 per DALY for comparative assessments. Furthermore, all the preventive interventions were less costly than the current malaria and anaemia control strategies that rely on clinical case management. This economic analysis supports the inclusion of both malaria chemoprophylaxis and iron supplementation delivered through EPI as part of the control strategies for these major killers of infants in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10686744"

Paradoxically, there has been no systematic examination of ethnic inequality in child survival chances across countries in the region. This paper uses survey data collected in the 1990s in 11 countries (Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Namibia, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, and Zambia) to examine whether ethnic inequality in child mortality has been present and spreading in sub-Saharan Africa since the 1980s. The focus was on one or two groups in each country which may have experienced distinct child health and survival chances, compared to the rest of the national population, as a result of their geographical location. The factors examined to explain potential child survival inequalities among ethnic groups included residence in the largest city, household economic conditions, educational attainment and nutritional status of the mothers, use of modern maternal and child health services including immunization, and patterns of fertility and migration. The results show remarkable consistency. In all 11 countries there were significant differentials between ethnic groups in the odds of dying during infancy or before the age of 5 years. Multivariate analysis shows that ethnic child mortality differences are closely linked with economic inequality in many countries, and perhaps with differential use of child health services in countries of the Sahel region. Strong and consistent results in this study support placing the notion of ethnicity at the forefront of theories and analyses of child mortality in Africa which incorporate social, and not purely epidemiological, considerations. Moreover, the typical advantage of relatively small, clearly defined ethnic groups, as compared to the majority in the national population, according to fundamental indicators of wellbeing--child survival, education, housing, and so forth--suggests that many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, despite their widespread poverty, are as marked by social inequality as are countries in other regions in the world.This paper uses survey data gathered in the 1990s from 11 countries to examine whether ethnic differentials in child mortality has been pronounced and spreading across sub-Saharan Africa since 1980s. Data were obtained from the Demographic and Health Surveys of the 11 countries conducted between 1990 and 1995. In each survey, women of reproductive age were asked for their ethnic affiliation. The study focused on one or two groups in each country experiencing distinct child health and survival chances. The factors examined to explain potential child survival inequalities among ethnic groups included residence in the largest city, household economic conditions, education attainment and nutritional status of mothers, use of modern maternal and child health services, and patterns of fertility and migration.

Countries with intermediate endemicity include India, Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and Thailand, and those with low endemicity include Japan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Malaysia. Most countries in Africa have high HBV endemicity, with the exceptions of Tunisia and Morocco, which have intermediate endemicity. Zambia has borderline intermediate/high endemicity.

All of these Middle East countries reach a large proportion of their population with hepatitis B vaccination, which is reducing the infection rate, particularly in Saudi Arabia. The vaccination programme in Taiwan has also greatly reduced the HBV infection rate.

Sickle cell hemoglobin C (13 cases) and sickle cell beta-thalassemia (three cases) were uncommon. Patients were aged from five months to 22 years (mean age: eight years). Most of them came from poor families. The mean number of children was five in patients' families, with at least two cases of SCD in 60% of them. Immunization against hepatitis B virus (10.2%), Haemophilus influenzae b (8.4%), Salmonella (8.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (21.4%) was insufficiently performed, because of its relatively high cost. Only 30% of the patients had received a blood transfusion. Painful crises occurred less than three times a year in 74% of the cases. Complications such as acute chest syndrome (1%), stroke (1%), cholelithiasis (9%), meningitis (0.4%), septicemia (2%) and osteomyelitis (6%) were rare. Mean steady state hemoglobin (Hb) and hemoglobin F(HbF) levels were 8.27 +/- 1.36 g/dL and 6.8 +/- 5.9% respectively among SS patients. No correlations were found neither between Hb and HbF nor between these parameters and the frequency of complications. Eleven patients (1.1% per year of follow-up) died, and infection was the main cause of death (73%).CONCLUSION: In comparison with published data, SCD seems to have mild severity in Senegalese children and adolescents in spite of poor follow-up conditions. In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors might have an important role in disease tolerance.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10668081"

In countries that have achieved high coverage of measles vaccine, an ideal opportunity exists to include control of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in enhanced measles control activities. Data on the burden of congenital rubella syndrome are important to guide rubella vaccination policies.METHODS: We reviewed the literature to identify studies of rubella antibody prevalence in developing countries that were conducted on populations with no major selection bias, prior to wide-scale rubella vaccination in the country. We used a simple catalytic model to describe the age-specific prevalence of susceptibility to rubella virus infection in given populations. Estimates of the incidence of infection among pregnant women were calculated using expressions for the average prevalence of susceptibility to infection and the incidence of infection during gestation. To estimate the number of cases of CRS, we assumed an overall risk of 65% after infection in the first 16 weeks of pregnancy and zero risk thereafter. These estimates were derived for each country for which data were available, then for each World Health Organization region, excluding Europe.RESULTS: The estimated mean incidence of CRS per 100,000 live births was lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (77.4, range 0-212) and highest in the Americas (175, range 0-598). The mean of the estimates of the total number of cases of CRS in developing countries in 1996 was approximately 110,000. The range was, however, very wide, from as few as 14,000 to as many as 308,000 cases.CONCLUSIONS: Congenital rubella syndrome is an under-recognized public health problem in many developing countries. There is an urgent need for collection of appropriate data to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a potential global rubella control programme.Inclusion of rubella vaccine in the national immunization program was found to be implemented in less than one-third of the developing countries in a review conducted by WHO. This paper examines the incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) cases in developing countries using published rubella infection prevalence. Documented literature of previous studies and medical data on women attending antenatal clinics were gathered and rubella antibody prevalence was identified before the wide-scale rubella vaccination. A catalytic model was used in describing age-specific prevalence of rubella virus infection in given populations, while expressions for the average prevalence of susceptibility to infection and incidence of infection during gestation was used to estimate the incidence of infection among pregnant women. Using the data gathered from each country and WHO regions, an overall risk of 65% after infection in the first 16 weeks and zero risk of defect later in pregnancy was assumed to estimate the incidence of CRS. Results revealed that the estimated mean incidence of CRS per 100,000 live births was significantly lower in the eastern Mediterranean region (77.4, range 0-212) and higher in the Americas (175, range 0-598). On the other hand, the 1996 CRS mean estimate for developing countries was approximately 110,000, ranging from 14,000 to 308,000 cases. This study concludes with the stated need for an improved CRS program in developing countries as well as adequate data collection necessary for cost-effectiveness evaluation of potential global rubella control programs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10661666"

Their principal use, however, has been in the administration of lyophilized vaccines from multidose vials to at-risk populations in developing countries. In 1983, a hepatitis B epidemic occurred among customers of a beauty clinic in California (USA) following the use of jet-injectors, demonstrating a clear risk of cross-contamination associated with this technique. As a result, the WHO and Unicef stopped recommending jet-injectors for collective immunizations in developing countries. To eliminate the risk of contamination, Pasteur Mérieux Sérums et Vaccins (now Aventis Pasteur) developed, in 1990, jet-injectors for use with single-use vaccine cartridges. These injectors were tested for tetanus toxoid, DTP, influenza, hepatitis A and typhoid Vi vaccination. The immunogenic reaction was as strong and the injection as well tolerated as for injections using a standard needle and syringe. The additional cost of the Imule technique was evaluated in a district-wide (127,000 inhabitants) tetanus toxoid immunization program at Velingara, Senegal in 1993. The total cost was estimated to be 1.51 FF (76 F CSA, 0.32 US dollars) for one dose of tetanus vaccine given by needle and syringe and 2.41 FF (121 F CSA, 0.56 US dollars) for one dose given by Imule. Thus, the additional cost of injection by ImuleTM was 0.90 FF (45 F CSA, 0.21 US dollars). The cost of cross infection in sub-Saharan Africa has been estimated to be 2.37 FF (118 F CSA, 0.55 US dollars) per injection if injection practices are not supervised. Therefore, the Imule technique may be considered to be cost-effective. However, the technique is still not completely reliable, as shown by the total breakdown of four jet injectors during this vaccination session. Lyophilized vaccines have also not been tested in the field. Vaccinators prefer Imule, training is easy and immunization can be carried out on a day-to-day basis with no vaccine wastage. Imule is not yet in mass production, which would reduce costs. In the face of the ever-increasing risk of cross-contamination during vaccination sessions in sub-Saharan Africa, the Imule technique deserves considerable attention.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10657777"

This study examines risk factors associated with seropositivity for HIV in Ethiopian children with clinical TB.METHODS: A prospective, controlled study of children with TB diagnosed in Addis Ababa from December 11, 1995, to January 28, 1997, in which HIV-positive children were compared with HIV-negative children with regard to sociodemographic background, previous medical history and vaccination.RESULTS: HIV prevalence among children with clinical TB was 11.2%. High educational status of mothers, low age, loss of one or two parents and earlier Calmette-Guérin bacillus (BCG) vaccination of the child were factors independently related to HIV infection.CONCLUSION: Factors associated with HIV infection among children with clinical TB include higher education of parents, higher income and better living conditions. The HIV epidemic might thus modify traditional risk factors for tuberculosis. It might also decrease the overall effect of BCG vaccination given that BCG did not provide protection in children infected with HIV. An expected increase of dually infected children who are younger, more in need of hospitalization and often lacking one or both parents will put an additional burden on the Ethiopian health care system.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11734713"

Epidemiological data on the burden of disease of HIV were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. The decision analysis model was constructed using estimates of lifetime chances of HIV infection. To assess threshold values for price and effectiveness, a maximum value for cost effectiveness in developing countries of $US100 was used in the base case. One-way and multivariate sensitivity analysis was performed on relevant parameters, assessing the impact of these parameters on the results of our analysis. In the base case, health benefits and consequences were discounted at a rate of 3%.STUDY PERSPECTIVE: Societal.RESULTS: According to our model, introduction of an HIV-1 vaccine in the EPI would result in the vaccination of 8717112 infants in sub-Saharan Africa per year. This corresponds to the prevention of 1839355 cases of HIV per year, gaining 16461800 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention would be $US3.4 per DALY gained (1998 values) at a vaccine price in the base case of $US5. At the same price the estimated size of the market would be approximately $US44536111 per year.CONCLUSION: If technological and financial problems associated with the development of an HIV vaccine can be solved, HIV vaccination in Africa could be both cost effective and potentially profitable.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11700780"

A number of immediate and long-term interventions were recommended, including the introduction of a vitamin A supplementation programme and a food fortification programme.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assist in the development and implementation of a national vitamin A supplementation programme at primary health care facilities for mothers and children. This was achieved by determining the design, coverage and cost of a national primary health care facility vitamin A supplementation programme.METHODS: Based on an extensive review of the literature, the main components of a primary health care facility vitamin A supplementation programme were identified. The annual, recurrent costs of each of the programme components were estimated for the nine provinces in South Africa. Immunisation coverage rates were used as a proxy for estimating the coverage of the programme.RESULTS: The main components of the programme were identified as: promotion, training, purchase of vitamin A capsules, distribution of vitamin A capsules to primary health care facilities, distribution of capsules to the programme beneficiaries, and monitoring and evaluation. The programme would operate from primary health care facilities and would target all children between 6 and 24 months of age and newly delivered mothers. It was estimated that the programme would cover 74% of children and 95% of postpartum women nationally. The total annual, recurrent cost of the national programme was estimated at R16.4 million. The bulk of the costs would include personnel costs, comprising 68% of the total costs. Other costs included promotion (27%), vitamin A capsules (4%) and training (1%). The cost of the programme would vary significantly by province, but the provinces' average total cost per beneficiary would be similar.CONCLUSION: A primary health care facility vitamin A supplementation programme has been designed and accompanied by an estimated overall cost and coverage for implementation. The findings of the study showed that the programme would be financially feasible and would reach the majority of children under 24 months of age.

The complete life-cycle was not described until just before the First World War, making it possible at last to plan proper community control programmes. Inadequate tools prevented their effective implementation until well after the Second World War when new tools became available, thanks to the newly formed World Health Organization. Molluscicides spearheaded control programmes until the late 1970s but were then replaced by the newly developed, safe drugs still used today. Whatever the method used, the initial goal of eradication was, in the light of experience and cost, gradually replaced by less ambitious targets; first to stop transmission and then to reduce morbidity. The most successful programmes combined several methods to minimise reinfection after chemotherapy. Comparisons between different programmes are difficult without using appropriate, standardised diagnostic techniques and the correct epidemiological measurements. Some examples will be presented, mainly from our studies on Schistosoma mansoni in Kenya. Drug resistance on a scale comparable with malaria has not occurred in schistosomiasis but the likely withdrawal of all drugs except praziquantel leaves its control extremely vulnerable to this potential problem. An effective, affordable vaccine for use in endemic countries is unlikely to be ready for at least 5 years, and developing strategies for its use could take a further decade or more, judging from experience with drugs and molluscicides. In the interim, by analogy with malaria, the most cost-effective approach would the use of drugs combined with other methods to stop transmission, including molluscicides. The cost of molluscicides needs to be reduced and fears allayed about their supposedly adverse ecological effects.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11586422"

The forces counteracting control measures, namely demographic factors, drug resistance, HIV, migration, poverty and marginalization, are enormous as well. With accelerated reforms in tuberculosis programs important progress can be made towards the control of tuberculosis early in the 21st century. This is confirmed by studying reports from countries where control measures have been implemented and sustained. Well-functioning programs can make good use of technological progress, such as improved tools for diagnosis and treatment, when these become available at an affordable cost. It is important now to use the opportunity of increased resources in order to reform tuberculosis programs. The biggest impact on global tuberculosis control in the 21st century can be made in Asia. Success in this part of the world depends on political commitment. Elsewhere, the main forces counteracting control measures are HIV in Africa and multidrug resistance in parts of Europe and the former Soviet Union. Here solutions are still on the drawing board. The long time-frame for tuberculosis control when using the currently recommended strategy, the uncertain impact of &quot;improved&quot; tools on this time-frame and the constant threat that political commitment will not be sustained are reasons why field workers look towards new technology in hope of progress in vaccine research. Here, the prospects are uncertain and the forecasted time-frame is long. Skeptics even doubt that an effective vaccine can be developed.

The maintenance of the cold chain in liquid nitrogen up to the time of inoculation and the cost of the reference long-acting oxytetracycline (Terramycin LA, Pfizer) are the main drawbacks of the method. The work presented in this paper aims at reducing the cost of immunisation against ECF by using an ice bath for the field delivery and a cheaper long-acting oxytetracycline formulation as chemotherapeutic agent. In experimental conditions, the results from 40 calves immunised after various periods of storage on ice ranging from 4 to 32 h indicate that deferred immunisation performed with a stabilate kept on ice for up to 6h after thawing has an efficiency of 90%. Moreover, sporozoites kept on ice were still surviving 32 h after thawing. In a field trial, 91 calves were inoculated with a stabilate kept for 3.5-5.5 h after thawing and dilution whereas 86 calves were immunised using the standard method. Clinical and parasitological reactions to immunisation were monitored as well as the seroconversion. In the field trial, the deferred immunisation was more efficient than the standard method. The acid formulation of oxytetracycline that was tested was found as suitable as the reference alkaline formulation for the chemotherapeutic control of the Katete strain in ECF immunisation. One indoor trial was carried out on 10 animals and a field trial involved 93 calves.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11502365"

The intention of these policy changes was to improve access to health services for previously disadvantaged communities. We investigated the impact of these changes on clinic attendance patterns in Hlabisa health district. Average quarterly new registrations and total attendances for preventive services (antenatal care, immunization, growth monitoring) and curative services (treatment of ailments) at a mobile primary health care unit were studied from 1992 to 1998. Regression analysis was undertaken to assess whether trends were statistically significant. There was a sustained increase in new registrations (P = 0.0001) and total attendances (P = 0.0001) for curative services, and a fall in new registrations (P = 0.01) and total attendances for immunization and growth monitoring (P = 0.0002) over the study period. The upturn in demand for curative services started at the time of the first policy change. The decreases in antenatal registrations (P = 0.07) and attendances (P = 0.09) were not statistically significant. The number of new registrations for immunization and growth monitoring increased following the first policy change but declined thereafter. We found no evidence that the second policy change influenced underlying trends. The removal of user fees improved access to curative services but this may have happened at the expense of some preventive services. Governments should remain vigilant about the effects of new health policies in order to ensure that objectives are being met.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11477970"

A total of 132 patients (109 SS, 22 SC and 1 S beta zero thal) followed up during one year from their admission date (period of 1st January 1996 to 31st December 1997). 132 patients were included in the study.RESULTS: The patients' age varied, for the majority, between 2 months and 15 years, but a few adults (15%) were included in the study. Information was collected from the hospital files and health cards, which unfortunately did not have specific entrees for sickle cell disease. Clinical features revealed that the frequency of tooth decay and chronic persistent splenomegaly was low when compared to the rates in central Africa (Bantu haplotype). Laboratory findings lead to the conclusion that some analysis are relevant such as the dosage of the G6PD activity (24.1% of patients were deficient), parasitologic analysis of faeces (positive in 22.5%), retinal fluoro-angiography (32.2% of ocular lesions), and cardiologic check-up. On the other hand, scanning of biliary tracts and systematic X-rays of the hips seems to be secondary. Some positive results were noticed by the scanning of biliary tracts without any therapeutic decisions in non-symptomatic patients; no case of osteonecrosis was detected by the X-rays. The mean haemoglobin level was 7.4 +/- 1.4 g/dl for the SS and 10.7 +/- 2.4 g/dl for the SC. The mean MCV were 91.3 +/- 10.1 fl and 82.1 +/- 7.7 fl, respectively. Specific vaccinations were not well performed because of their high cost.CONCLUSION: In order to carry on and improve the ambulatory management of patients with sickle cell disease, it is important in low income countries, such as Togo, to target the necessary laboratory tests for an initial and annual check-up. Solidarity networks for patients should be promoted and effective involvement of the health authorities ensured.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11475024"

These manifestations in patients, communities, and countries reflect intrinsic (human, parasite, mosquito) and extrinsic (environmental, social, behavioral, political, and economic conditions as well as disease-control efforts) determinants. At a minimum, between 700,000 and 2.7 million persons die yearly from malaria, over 75% of them African children. Between 400 and 900 million acute febrile episodes occur yearly in African children under 5 yr of age living in endemic areas. Although about half of these children are parasitemic, all merit consideration of malaria-specific therapy, which is becoming more problematic because of parasite resistance to drugs. These numbers will more than double over the next 20 yr without effective control. Fewer than 20% of these febrile episodes and deaths come to the attention of any formal health system. The relatively few ill patients who have any contact with the health services represent the &quot;ears of the hippopotamus.&quot; Greatly intensified research activities and control of the intolerable burden of malaria are mandatory if economic development is to accelerate in Africa. In particular, support should be targeted to understanding and preventing malaria-induced anemia, hypoglycemia, effects on pregnancy, and neurologic and developmental impairment. To decrease and stop transmission of this intolerable scourge, there is an urgent need for malaria vaccines, newer drugs, and better vector control methods as well as the ability to improve current technologies and use them more efficiently.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11425172"
"49","Future access to HIV vaccines. Report from a WHO-UNAIDS Consultation, Geneva, 2-3 October 2000.","eng","England","11399975",2001,6,16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA NA","Results from the first phase III efficacy trial of an HIV vaccine will be available within the next 2-3 years. Thus, it is imperative to start planning now to address how any effective vaccines should be used. In the absence of definitive information on the characteristics of the first generation of HIV vaccines, the following assumptions were made: the vaccine will (i) have only low to moderate efficacy (on the order of 50%); (ii) not be inexpensive (on the order of 10 to 30 US $ per dose); (iii) require multiple doses; and, (iv) at least initially, be available in limited quantities. A vaccine with that profile would not be suitable for general use in all countries, and it might have to be initially targeted to populations at higher risk of HIV infection. These populations will differ from region to region, according to the epidemiological situation. In most high and middle income countries potential target groups for an initial HIV immunization programme would include intravenous drug users, gay men, commercial sex workers, and high-risk heterosexuals, as well as healthcare workers exposed to blood. In sub-Saharan Africa, future HIV immunization programmes might include larger segments of the population. In order to plan future vaccination programmes it is important to estimate the need (size of target population) and the demand (uptake in target populations) for future HIV vaccines. In addition to the public sector demand for an HIV vaccine (to be used in public health programmes), there will also be a private sector demand driven by the willingness and ability of individuals and employers to pay for the vaccine. HIV vaccines would need to be delivered as part of comprehensive HIV prevention packages, including behavioral and health promotion interventions. This would be especially important with vaccines of moderate efficacy, in order to prevent increased risk behavior among vaccine recipients. To avoid false expectations, the vaccine message would need to be recast as part of the total prevention strategy, rather than the &quot;magic bullet&quot; that people have come to expect. Initial deployment of HIV vaccines could proceed through targeted vaccination campaigns, drawing from experience with other vaccines. These campaigns would be complex and expensive, and would require full participation and collaboration from all levels of the community, as well as considerable strengthening of the infrastructures required for vaccine delivery. Current candidate vaccines in phase III trials may not be appropriate for much of Africa and South Asia, two areas most in need of an HIV vaccine. Credible international efforts (''push and pull&quot; mechanisms) are needed to create incentives for the industry to develop vaccines for these regions. Feasible financing mechanisms may have to be established to cover the cost of production and delivery of vaccines, in order to ensure equitable access to HIV vaccines around the world. In parallel to the deployment of the initial vaccine, additional bridging studies and effectiveness trials may be needed to expand vaccine use. Research should also continue at an increased pace to develop new generations of more effective vaccines, especially vaccines appropriate to Africa. Achieving these goals will require real political commitment from government and international organizations, to be materialized in specific actions and budget allocations. The daunting challenge of making future effective vaccines accessible to all populations in need will require a sustained collaborative effort on the part of all parties involved.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11399975"

In the absence of an effective and affordable vaccine, control programmes continue to rely on case management while attempting the large-scale deployment of insecticide-treated nets. We did a randomised, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of intermittent sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment on the rate of malaria and severe anaemia in infants in a rural area of Tanzania.METHODS: We randomly assigned 701 children living in Ifakara, southern Tanzania, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine or placebo at 2, 3, and 9 months of age. All children received iron supplementation between 2 and 6 months of age. The intervention was given alongside routine vaccinations delivered through WHO's Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI). The primary outcome measures were first or only episode of clinical malaria, and severe anaemia in the period from recruitment to 1 year of age. Morbidity monitoring through a hospital-based passive case-detection system was complemented by cross-sectional surveys at 12 and 18 months of age. Results were expressed in terms of protective efficacy (100 [1-hazard ratio]%) and analysis was by intention to treat.FINDINGS: 40 children dropped out (16 died, 11 migrated, 12 parents withdrew consent, and one for other reasons). Intermittent sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment was well tolerated and no drug-attributable adverse events were recorded. During the first year of life, the rate of clinical malaria (events per person-year at risk) was 0.15 in the sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine group versus 0.36 in the placebo group (protective efficacy 59% [95% CI 41-72]), and the rate of severe anaemia was 0.06 in the sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine group versus 0.11 in the placebo group (50% [8-73]). Serological responses to EPI vaccines were not affected by the intervention.INTERPRETATION: This new approach to malaria control reduced the rate of clinical malaria and severe anaemia by delivering an available and affordable drug through the existing EPI system. Data are urgently needed to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of intermittent treatment in areas with different patterns of malaria endemicity.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11377597"

Plans for the subsequent global eradication of measles are in an advanced stage. Eradication of both polio and measles incorporate as a fundamental strategy high routine coverage, surveillance and special national immunisation days (NIDs), which are supplementary to routine vaccination services. There has been a lively debate on whether poor countries, with many health problems that could be controlled, should divert their limited resources for a global goal of eradication that may have low priority for their children. From a cost-effectiveness perspective, NIDs are fully justifiable. However, field observations in sub-saharan Africa show that NIDs divert resources and, to a certain extent, attention from the development of comprehensive primary health care (PHC). The routine immunisation coverage rates dropped on average since the introduction of NIDs in 1996, which is contrary to what was observed in the western Pacific and other regions. The additional investment to be made when moving from disease control to eradication may exceed the financial capacity of an individual country. Since the industrialised countries benefit most from eradication, they should take responsibility for covering the needs of those countries that cannot afford the investment. The WHO's frequent argument that NIDs are promotive to PHC is not confirmed in the southern African region. The authors think that the WHO should, therefore, focus its attention on diminishing the negative side-effects of NIDs and on getting the positive side-effects incorporated in the integrated health services in a sustainable way.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11291425"

The simulated campaign incorporated modestly effective vaccine coverage, bed net use, and larval control. The results indicate that such campaigns would reduce EIRs at all four sites by 30- to 50-fold. Even without the vaccine, 15- to 25-fold reductions of EIR were predicted, implying that integrated control with a few modestly effective tools can meaningfully reduce malaria transmission in a range of endemic settings. The model accurately predicts the effects of bed nets and indoor spraying and demonstrates that they are the most effective tools available for reducing EIR. However, the impact of domestic adult vector control is amplified by measures for reducing the rate of emergence of vectors or the level of infectiousness of the human reservoir. We conclude that available tools, including currently neglected methods for larval control, can reduce malaria transmission intensity enough to alleviate mortality. Integrated control programs should be implemented to the fullest extent possible, even in areas of intense transmission, using simple models as decision-making tools. However, we also conclude that to eliminate malaria in many areas of intense transmission is beyond the scope of methods which developing nations can currently afford. New, cost-effective, practical tools are needed if malaria is ever to be eliminated from highly endemic areas.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11289662"

Of the 157 practices that responded, all were presented with cases of babesiosis and most were situated in Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Apart from the Western Cape, a winter-rainfall region, the prevalence of babesiosis cases in dogs was highest in summer. Most of the respondent practices treated between 1,000 and 5,000 sick dogs that included 100 to 500 babesiosis cases each year. Respondents identified cerebral babesiosis, enterorrhagia, 'red' or haemoconcentrated babesiosis, acute renal failure and pulmonary babesiosis or 'shock lung', amongst others, as the most prevalent forms of complicated ('atypical') babesiosis. Diminazene, imidocarb and trypan blue were the most popular antibabesials. Trypan blue was most often used in shocked patients, whereas diminazene and imidocarb were preferred when there was a high parasitaemia in the absence of shock. At least 19 antibabesial treatment regimens were used in practices. These comprised the use of single doses of antibabesial drugs; split doses with repeat injections, and combined drug variations, some of which are undesirable due to possible sterilisation of Babesia infection or potential toxicity. Side-effects were most commonly associated with imidocarb use. Ninety-six percent of respondents used supportive treatment (e.g. corticosteroids, vitamins and 'liver support') in all cases of babesiosis. The use of blood transfusion as supportive treatment varied according to practice and severity of the case. Most practices never cross-matched blood to be transfused, and transfusion reactions were rare. Diminazene was most frequently incriminated in cases where drug 'resistance' or relapses occurred. Cerebral and 'red' cases resulted in high mortality. Treatment of babesiosis costs the dog-owning public in South Africa more than R20 million each year.

Vaccination against Anaplasma marginale by administration of an Anaplasma centrale live-blood vaccine has been practiced in this country since 1912. Although generally a mild pathogen, Anaplasma centrale can cause severe clinical reactions following vaccination and also does not afford complete protection against all A. marginale isolates. Anaplasmosis vaccine is routinely available in a deep-frozen form and approximately 220,000 doses of vaccine are sold per annum. Microscopic examination of stained thin blood smears is still the most reliable and cost effective method of confirming a clinical diagnosis of anaplasmosis. Several diagnostic tests, such as the complement fixation tests, card agglutination test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been developed to identify carrier cattle. A competitive inhibition ELISA test, based on antibody binding to a recombinant MSP-5 protein conserved among Anaplasma species, is routinely used at this laboratory.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11193662"

Productivity parameters (fecundity and mortality rates) obtained with and without prophylaxis were fitted into a benefit-cost economic analysis model and run for project lifespans varying from one to five years. At a 7% discount rate, the overall benefits for a project lifespan of five years were estimated as over 15 million FCFA and 11 million FCFA for sheep and goats, respectively.

Costs of device purchase and usage were derived from the literature, while costs of direct medical care and lost productivity from HBV and HIV disease were based on data collected in 1999 in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Uganda. Multivariate sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulation characterized uncertainties in model parameters. Costs were summed from both the societal and health care system payer's perspectives.FINDINGS: Resterilizable and disposable needles and syringes had the highest overall costs for device purchase, usage, and iatrogenic disease: median US dollars 26.77 and US dollars 25.29, respectively, per injection from the societal perspective. Disposable-cartridge jet injectors and automatic needle-shielding syringes had the lowest costs, US dollars 0.36 and US dollars 0.80, respectively. Reusable-nozzle jet injectors and auto-disable needle and syringes were intermediate, at US dollars 0.80 and US dollars 0.91, respectively, per injection.CONCLUSION: Despite their nominal purchase and usage costs, conventional needles and syringes carry a hidden but huge burden of iatrogenic disease. Alternative injection devices for the millions of injections administered annually in sub-Saharan Africa would be of value and should be considered by policy-makers in procurement decisions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12481207"

ComDT should result in less diversion of drugs, better indications for sustainability, and less distraction of village life. The difficulties encountered in the program included poor reporting (more of a problem in the program-designed than in the community-designed delivery system) and supply failure (which depends upon the support of the health system).

The offending organism was identical to the strain that caused the smaller epidemic in Saudi Arabia in 2000. Due to the shortage of tetravalent meningococcal vaccine against N.m.

Repeated identification of this serogroup in Burkina Faso during 2002 raises the risk that similar outbreak will occur in the meningitis belt during the next epidemic season. The high cost of tetravalent meningococcal vaccine compounded with the only progressive increase in production capacity underline the need to reinforce surveillance of circulating strains and available treatment facilities.

According to World Health Organization estimates, at least 1 million children under 5 years of age die each year from pneumococcal pneumonia. The emergence of resistant strains necessitates the development of an effective vaccine with a large serotype coverage. The 11 most common serotypes cause 72-83% of all serious pneumococcal diseases worldwide. Currently marketed 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine provides large serotype coverage and offers a less expensive option. However, it is efficacious only in adults but not in infants. Conjugate vaccines offer a solution by generating immunological memory already at early age. A recently licensed 7-valent conjugate vaccine is immunogenic and efficacious in infants. Its serotype coverage might be sufficient in Europe and North America, but not in Africa, Asia and Oceania. A need exists to develop pneumococcal vaccines with lower cost and larger serotype coverage. Several 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are being evaluated in phase I-III trials.

Smear-negative TB, which is common in children and patients who have HIV infection, is becoming a major problem in resource-poor settings where access to mycobacterial culture and histopathology is limited. Clinical case definitions are being developed to address this problem. Short courses of rifampin-based therapy are not universally available, but access is increasing. DOTS is the main strategy that the WHO is promoting to improve TB control. This is particularly important for sputum smear-positive patients. Unfortunately, the DOTS targets set by the WHO have not yet been met. Innovative, low-cost ways of supervising therapy have been developed using family members or lay supervisors. Preventive therapy in tropical countries is limited to high-risk cases (young children and HIV-infected patients who are tuberculin skin test-positive).

In the year 2000, the programme, in partnership with governments, non-governmental organizations and the endemic communities themselves, succeeded in treating 20,298,138 individuals in 49,654 communities in 63 projects in 14 countries. Besides the distribution of ivermectin, the programme has strengthened primary healthcare (PHC) through capacity-building, mobilization of resources and empowerment of communities. The community-directed-treatment approach is a model that can be adopted in developing other community-based health programmes. The approach has also made it possible to bring to the poor some measure of intervention in some other healthcare programmes, such as those for malaria control, eye care, maternal and child health, nutrition and immunization. CDTI presents, at all stages of its implementation, a unique window of opportunity for promoting the functional integration of healthcare activities. For this to be done successfully and in a co-ordinated manner, adequate funding of CDTI within PHC is as important as an effective sensitization of the relevant policy-makers, healthworkers and communities on the value of integration (accompanied by appropriate training at all levels). Evaluation of the experiences in integration of health services, particularly at community level, is crucial to the success of the integration.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12081254"

Only 3/756 children (0.4%) were HBsAg positive and a fourth child was anti-HBc positive (HBsAg negative). This is a marked decrease compared to the hepatitis B prevalences reported in previous studies.

The animals of the sentinel herds were closely monitored clinically and serologically together with detailed Rhipicephalus appendiculatus counts. Peaks of disease incidence occurred in the rainy season (December-February) and the dry months of May-July with nymph-to-adult tick transmission dominating the infection dynamics. A second wave of adult R. appendiculatus at the start of the dry season is essential for the occurrence of a full-blown epidemic while the size of the susceptible cattle population acts as a most important limiting factor. The majority of adult cattle of the sentinel herds became infected less than 2 years after the introduction of the disease. The median age at first contact for calves born towards the end of the study (1999) was about 6 months. The case-fatality ratio (including sub-clinical cases) is estimated at 60%. It is argued that part of the so-called 'natural mortality' is actually due to ECF and that ECF occurrence and mortality are systematically underestimated. The direct financial cost of the epidemic, based on loss of animals and cost of treatment only and calculated over 4 years running, is estimated at about 6 US dollars per year per animal at risk. The value of the traditional seroprevalence survey as a tool for monitoring ECF epidemiology is put in question and the prevalence of maternal antibodies in new-born calves, reflecting the immune status of the dam population, is introduced as an alternative. It is demonstrated that an efficient immunisation campaign should concentrate its efforts in the period of low adult R. appendiculatus abundance (July-October).","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12072213"

Cattle inoculated with the recombinant virus (rLSDV-RG) developed humoral immunity that was demonstrated in ELISA and neutralisation assays to RV. High titres of up to 1513IU/ml of RV neutralising antibodies were induced. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from rLSDV-RG-immunised animals demonstrated the ability to proliferate in response to stimulation with inactivated RV, whereas the animal vaccinated with wild type LSDV did not. This recombinant vaccine candidate thus has the potential to be used in ruminants as a cost-effective vaccine against both lumpy skin disease (LSD) and rabies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12034095"

In spite of the current controversy regarding the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide vaccine, its safety, effectiveness in the field and low cost should justify the renewal of a debate on its use in routine vaccination. Routine--or preventive--vaccination could significantly reduce the incidence of meningococcal meningitis as well as its severity. The conjugate vaccine, when available, will constitute an additional advantage in the prevention of meningococcal meningitis.

This paper examines, through a literature review, the impact of tuberculosis control measures on tuberculosis mortality and transmission, and constraints to scaling-up. It also provides estimates of the effectiveness of various interventions using a model proposed by Styblo. It concludes that treatment of smear-positive tuberculosis using the WHO directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy has by far the highest impact. While BCG immunization reduces childhood tuberculosis mortality, its impact on tuberculosis transmission is probably minimal. Under specific conditions, an additional impact on mortality and transmission can be expected through treatment of smear-negative cases, intensification of case-finding for smear-positive tuberculosis, and preventive therapy among individuals with dual tuberculosis-HIV infection. Of these interventions, DOTS is the most cost-effective at around US$ 5-40 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gained. The cost for BCG immunization is likely to be under US$ 50 per DALY gained. Treatment of smear-negative patients has a cost per DALY gained of up to US$ 100 in low-income countries, and up to US$ 400 in middle-income settings. Other interventions, such as preventive therapy for HIV-positive individuals, appear to be less cost-effective. The major constraint to scaling up DOTS is lack of political commitment, resulting in shortages of funding and human resources for tuberculosis control. However, in recent years there have been encouraging signs of increasing political commitment. Other constraints are related to involvement of the private sector, health sector reform, management capacity of tuberculosis programmes, treatment delivery, and drug supply. Global tuberculosis control could benefit strongly from technical innovation, including the development of a vaccine giving good protection against smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in adults; simpler and shorter drug regimens for treatment of tuberculosis disease and infection; and improved diagnostics for tuberculosis infection and disease.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11984608"

Today the disease still affects as many as 200,000 persons annually in tropical regions of Africa and South America, and poses a significant hazard to unvaccinated travellers to these areas. Yellow fever is transmitted in a cycle involving monkeys and mosquitoes, but human beings can also serve as the viraemic host for mosquito infection. Recent increases in the density and distribution of the urban mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, as well as the rise in air travel increase the risk of introduction and spread of yellow fever to North and Central America, the Caribbean and Asia. Here I review the clinical features of the disease, its pathogenesis and pathophysiology. The disease mechanisms are poorly understood and have not been the subject of modern clinical research. Since there is no specific treatment, and management of patients with the disease is extremely problematic, the emphasis is on preventative vaccination. As a zoonosis, yellow fever cannot be eradicated, but reduction of the human disease burden is achievable through routine childhood vaccination in endemic countries, with a low cost for the benefits obtained.

We did an assessment in four African countries to report the experiences of ministries of health and their partners in applying to GAVI for funds to strengthen health systems and for new vaccines. Countries welcomed the introduction of hepatitis B vaccine, safe injection equipment, and the financial support to strengthen immunisation programmes. All reported that the pace of the application process was too rapid. District visits revealed low staffing levels, insufficient transport and fuel, poorly functioning cold chains, and infrequent supervision. Information systems were unreliable, which will be an obstacle to GAVI when monitoring and rewarding improvements in immunisation coverage. Also, the high cost of expensive new vaccines will be difficult to sustain if GAVI funding stops at the end of its 5 year commitment. Our study suggests that applications for support and planning for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria control under the new Global Fund, will be more complex and demanding on already over-stretched ministries of health. Further, the rapid onset of activities, coupled with uncertainty about the time-scale of donor commitment, could be problematic. A limited and carefully assessed set of initial activities, focusing on where and how to strengthen existing country systems, is more likely to be successful and could provide useful models for scaling-up to larger programmes in different contexts.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11844535"

Recent studies have shown that low-cost regimens can prevent some of the most important causes of HIV-related disease in African countries. Isoniazid preventive therapy can reduce the incidence of tuberculosis; priorities are to seek opportunities for implementation, to assess effectiveness under operational conditions, and to monitor its effect on resistance patterns. Cotrimoxazole was shown to be highly effective in reducing morbidity and mortality among individuals with symptomatic HIV disease in Côte d'Ivoire, and should be implemented where it is likely to be of benefit. Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was disappointingly ineffective among HIV-infected Ugandan adults, but newer conjugate vaccines are becoming available that should be investigated. The benefit of these preventive regimens to the individual may be modest when compared with the effect of antiretroviral therapy. However, simple preventive therapies could reach a much wider population than is immediately feasible for expensive and complex antiretroviral regimens, and thus have the potential for substantial benefit at the population level. The availability of effective and affordable regimens to prevent HIV-related disease may also encourage people to seek HIV testing, combat denial, and help overcome the sense of powerlessness in countries where the HIV epidemic has hit hardest.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11791979"

To aid in diagnosis and differentiation of vaccinated from infected animals, we developed indirect ELISAs (iELISAs) that use baculovirus-expressed RPV or PPRV nucleoprotein as coating antigens. A single larva contains enough viral antigen to test more than 10,000 serum samples, in duplicate. African scientists trained at the ILMB successfully transferred the iELISA kit technology to more than 30 countries in Africa, providing a model for technology transfer among developing countries. Vaccination with v2RVFH, in conjunction with the iELISA kits, greatly enhances the prospects for global eradication of rinderpest, as developing nations achieve independence in control efforts.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14677681"

We simulated the expected cost and impact of the vaccination strategies for an annual cohort of 400,000 children, assuming 80% vaccination coverage in both routine and SIAs and an analytic horizon of 15 years. A vaccination program which includes SIAs reaching children not previously vaccinated would prevent on additional 29,242 measles cases and 1462 deaths for each vaccinated birth cohort when compared with a one-dose program.

Interventions to prevent varicella transmission in HCW groups of uncertain immunity prove labor intensive, costly, and disruptive. Therefore, documentation of total varicella immunity in HCWs is desirable.SETTING: The National Guard King Abdulaziz Medical City is a 600-bed tertiary care center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with a multinational staff.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A program to assess the VZV status of HCWs was initiated in 1999. The survey was confined to HCWs having direct patient contact. Questions elucidated previous history of varicella (chicken pox) infection, antibody testing against varicella, and varicella vaccination. HCWs with a negative or unknown history were subsequently tested for varicella antibodies (IgG).RESULTS: Seventy-six percent (2,047) of the HCWs responded to the questionnaire. Of these, 562 (28%) were physicians, 761 (37%) were nurses, 438 (21%) were medical technicians, and 286 (14%) were involved in clerical work. A total of 802 (39%) were from the Middle East including Saudi Arabia, 633 (31%) were from the Far East, 361 (18%) were from the West and from temperate areas, 138 (7%) were from South Africa, and 113 (5%) were from other nationalities. A previous history of VZV infection was reported by 1303 (64%); 262 (13%) had a history of positive test for varicella antibody, and only 44 (2%) had a history of varicella vaccination. Of the 744 (36%) HCWs who had a negative or unknown history of VZV infection, 217 (29%) underwent antibody testing. Of these, 181 (83%) proved to be immune (IgG &gt; or = 1.10), and 36 (17%) nonimmune (IgG &lt; 1.2). The latter group have completed varicella immunization. Staff from the West (81%), Far East (78%), and South Africa (59%) reported more histories of VZV infection compared with the employees of Middle Eastern origin (46%) (P &lt;.001) and disclosed a history of positive antibodies in 13%, 18%, 17%, and 8%, respectively (P &lt;.001). In relation to occupation, nurses reported history of varicella infection (75%) and a history of positive varicella antibodies (16%) more than physicians (54% and 8%, respectively) (P &lt;.05). Conversely, serologic immunity to VZV infection proved consistent among the different nationalities and among the 4 occupational groups.CONCLUSION: Total varicella immunity of a multinational workforce can be realized through screening of HCWs and vaccination of susceptible individuals. It is preferred above repeated interventions after varicella exposure for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. Knowledge of VZV infection varies between different nationalities and cannot be used as a true predictor of immunity. There is no difference in the immunity by antibody testing of staff recruited from temperate and tropical climates. Total varicella immunity should, therefore, be achieved through screening of all HCWs and vaccination of those susceptible.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14608306"

The introduction of H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines into routine immunisation schedules in developed countries has been followed by a rapid decline in disease occurrence, but vaccine cost is a significant barrier to use in developing countries. There is a need to determine the size of the effects of the vaccine, to enable cost-effectiveness comparisons with competing priorities in developing countries.OBJECTIVES: 1. To determine the effects of conjugate Hib vaccine in preventing Hib disease or death in children under five years.2. To determine any serious adverse outcomes.SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (issue 1, 2003); MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2003), EMBASE (1990 to April 2003); and scanning of reference lists and contacting of authors of trial reports. Reports in all languages were considered.SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials of conjugate H. influenzae type b vaccines compared with placebo or no treatment in children who were followed until at least two years of age.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two investigators independently selected eligible studies and extracted data. Differences were resolved by discussion.MAIN RESULTS: Five studies were included in the review, and four in meta-analyses. The overall quality of the trials was good. The relative risk for invasive Hib disease was 0.20 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.54; random effects model), but there was statistically significant unexplained variation (heterogeneity) in the effects of the four trials in the meta-analysis (p = 0.002). The size of the effects found in the trials did not appear to differ consistently with different vaccine types, the number of vaccine doses, age at first vaccination or use in developed vs developing countries, but the confidence intervals for the effect estimates were wide.Hib-related mortality data showed a non-significant trend towards benefit (relative risk was 0.29; 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 1.20; random effects model). The relative risk for all cause mortality in the single trial from which data were available was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.38 to 2.67, random effects model). No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the trials, involving a total of 257,000 infants.S CONCLUSIONS: Hib vaccine is safe and effective. The size of the effect could plausibly be anywhere between a 46% and 93% reduction in Hib invasive disease, before the effect of herd immunity is taken into account. In resource-poor settings, decisions to use the vaccine will depend on its cost, the local burden of Hib disease and competing priorities. Insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials was identified of the effects of Hib conjugate vaccine on either Hib-specific or on all-cause mortality.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14583937"

Data on various social and medical parameters were collected and analysed.FINDINGS: Blood haemoglobin concentrations (Hb) were available for 1979 of the 2131 (93%) children identified and ranged from 1.7 to 18.6 g/dl. Overall, 87% (1722) of children had an Hb &lt;11 g/dl, 39% (775) had an Hb &lt;8 g/dl and 3% (65) had an Hb &lt;5 g/dl. The highest prevalence of anaemia of all three levels was in children aged 6-11 months, of whom 10% (22/226) had an Hb &lt;5 g/dl. However, the prevalence of anaemia was already high in children aged 1-5 months (85% had an Hb &lt;11 g/dl, 42% had an Hb &lt;8 g/dl, and 6% had an Hb &lt;5 g/dl). Anaemia was usually asymptomatic and when symptoms arose they were nonspecific and rarely identified as a serious illness by the care provider. A recent history of treatment with antimalarials and iron was rare. Compliance with vaccinations delivered through the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) was 82% and was not associated with risk of anaemia.CONCLUSION: Anaemia is extremely common in south-eastern United Republic of Tanzania, even in very young infants. Further implementation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness algorithm should improve the case management of anaemia. However, the asymptomatic nature of most episodes of anaemia highlights the need for preventive strategies. The EPI has good coverage of the target population and it may be an appropriate channel for delivering tools for controlling anaemia and malaria.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14576890"

We investigated the possibility of transgenic plant expression of the Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 L1 major capsid protein, with and without nuclear localisation signals, in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi plants. The genes were stably integrated into the N. tabacum genome, and both the expressed proteins were capable of assembling into capsomers and virus-like particles. The proteins in concentrated leaf extracts (L1(Tr)) were tested for antigenicity using a panel of characterised monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Neutralising and conformation-specific Mabs (H16:V5 and H16:E70) were shown to bind to both types of the plant-produced particles. We estimated the L1(Tr) product yield to be 2-4 microg per kg of fresh leaf material. Rabbits immunised with small doses of plant-produced particles elicited a weak anti-HPV-16 L1 immune response.

We undertook a two-year, prospective birth cohort study in a rural Kenyan District Hospital to estimate cause-specific mortality and severe morbidity in infants too young to gain benefit from routine immunization approaches. A total of 2,359 infants eligible for the cohort were delivered. Of these, 136 (6%) were stillborn and 77 (3.5%) subsequently died. Prematurity (34%), birth asphyxia (27%), and infection (18.5%) were the predominant causes of death in the first 98 days of life, although infection accounted for 36% of all life-threatening illness episodes in the same period. The data suggest that health system constraints are likely to impede programmatic efforts to reduce early infant mortality and morbidity, and that infection prevention measures offer some promise for mortality reduction. Assessing the cost effectiveness of the latter, particularly for very specific interventions such as further maternal vaccination, will require very large trials.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=13677381"

Investigations included estimations of packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb), serum iron (Fe), unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) and total iron-binding Capacity (TIBC). Forty percent of the infants had PCVs below 0.32, 48% had Hbs below 10 g/dl and 27% had mean corpuscular volume (MVC) less that 70fl. Thirty-seven percent of the children had serum Fe below 3.58 mmol/l, but only 4% had UIBC above 320 mmol/l. Fifty-two percent had Transferin Saturation Index (TSI) below 10%. Eighteen percent had MCV below 70fl associated with TSI below 10% and 67% of these had Hbs below 10 g/dl. The prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in infants as shown in this study is very high. The ill effects of iron deficiency in childhood have been well documented. It is suggested that screening for anaemia should be offered at 9 months as part of a Child Survival Programme and that infants found to be anaemic should be treated. However, for cost-effectiveness and taking into consideration the high prevalence rate of iron deficiency in this age group, it might be preferable to give iron and weekly prophylactic antimalarias routinely to infants aged 9 to 15 months in lieu of screening.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12953983"

Risk factors for rotavirus infection included old age, wasting, high Vesikari score and the episode occurring in the dry season. Rotavirus-positive episodes tended to be more acute, causing vomiting and greater dehydration, and were more likely to require hospitalization. The incidence was 0.089 episodes per person-year for all diarrhoea, and 0.035 for rotavirus diarrhoea. The observed incidence decreased markedly with distance from the nearest health centre, suggesting a large unobserved burden. G2P[6], G3P[4] and G9P[8] made up more than half the genotypes detected, but the remainder were diverse. There is a large burden of rotavirus diarrhoea, but the effectiveness of future vaccines could be diluted by the high polymorphism of the virus, and the difficulty of reaching remote populations.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12950670"

In terms of participation, by professional grouping, laboratory workers and nurses recorded the lowest rates (82.5% and 84% respectively), while 100% participation was recorded in respect of the staff of engineering, medical records, pharmacy and physiotherapy departments. The highest rate of compliance (receipt of three doses) was also found among non-clinical workers (medical record personnel--76.3% and engineering staff--69.5%) while the lowest rate was found among nurses (39.7%) and doctors (40.3%).CONCLUSION: Workers with the highest possibility of knowledge of, and exposure to hepatitis B infection within the hospital setting--doctors, nurses, and laboratory workers--showed the greatest apathy to the vaccination programme. Reasons for this trend demand close examination, and subsequently, identification of specific action that needs to be taken to improve the uptake of the vaccine by the target population, particularly the high-risk groups, in future programmes. Among others, targeting all groups of workers with appropriate education on the infection; active involvement of professional groups in the planning and execution of the vaccination programme; and review of the implementation logistics are some of the key points to note for future programmes.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12862107"

We do not accept the view that scaling-up this method should be by making villagers pay for nets and insecticide, with subsidies limited so as not to discourage the private sector. We consider that ITNs should be viewed as a public good, like vaccines, and should be provided via the public sector with generous assistance from donors. Our experience is that teams distributing free ITNs, replacing them after about 4 years when they are torn and retreating them annually, have high productivity and provide more comprehensive and equitable coverage than has been reported for marketing systems. Very few of the free nets are misused or sold. The estimated cost would be an annual expenditure of about US$295 million to provide for all of rural tropical Africa where most of the world's malaria exists. This expenditure is affordable by the world community as a whole, but not by its poorest members.

Health cards from 126 under five years old children belonging to the respondents were reviewed for immunization status and regularity of growth monitoring.RESULTS: The mean age of the 385 CSWs surveyed was 32 +/- 7 years and mean duration of sex work was 6 +/- 4 years. The mean number of living children was 3.4 +/- 2 and 81.2% of the mothers lived with their children. Three quarters of the CSWs practised prostitution at home. The most common daily childcare activities by the mothers were food preparation (96.2%) and washing children's clothes (91.3%). Overall 96.8% of their under-five years old children were fully immunized and 80% of their under one year old children had their growth monitored monthly. About three quarters of the mothers with adolescent children educated them on HIV/STDs. Health seeking behaviour for the children was hampered by health care cost (71.4%) and consumption of alcohol by the mothers. Like other mothers, the CSWs encouraged their adolescent children to take up some adult roles such as maintaining a clean house (93.3%). However only 2.0% took time to converse or counsel the children. Focus group discussions (FGDs) with the CSWs showed that children were left unattended at night while the mothers went out in search of clients. Efforts to provide better education for the children were undermined by lack of funds (52.2%) and truancy (46.6%). One third of the study population had invested for the future maintenance of their children.CONCLUSION: There was more emphasis on physical, rather than psychological aspect of childcare. The practice of living with the children ensured that earnings from the sex trade were used for the immediate needs of the children such as food. However this practice had a negative influence on the children as the majority of the respondents conducted their sexual business at home with little or no privacy. Health seeking behaviour for the children was hampered by lack of funds and to some extent alcohol consumption by the mothers. Efforts to invest in the education of their children were undermined by lack of funds and truancy.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12638835"

According to the International Health Regulations, many countries require yellow fever vaccination and proof thereof as the International Certificate of vaccination. Additionally selected countries require proof of vaccination against cholera and meningococcal disease. A consultation for travel health advice is always an opportunity to ascertain that routine immunizations have been performed. Recommended immunizations often are more important for traveller's health than the required or routine ones. The most frequent vaccine preventable infection in non-immune travellers to developing countries is hepatitis A with an average incidence rate of 0.3% per month; in high risk backpackers or foreign-aid-volunteers this rate is 2.0%. Many immunizations are recommended for special risk groups only: there is a growing tendency in many countries to immunize all young travellers to developing countries against hepatitis B, as it is uncertain who will voluntarily or involuntarily get exposed. The attack rate of influenza in intercontinental travel is estimated to be 1%. Immunity against poliomyelitis remains essential for travel to Africa and parts of Asia. Many of the 0.2-0.4% who experience an animal bite are at risk of rabies. Typhoid fever is diagnosed with an incidence rate of 0.03% per month among travellers to the Indian subcontinent, North and West Africa (except Tunisia), and Peru, elsewhere this rate is 10-fold lower. Meningococcal disease, Japanese encephalitis, cholera and tuberculosis have been reported in travellers, but these infections are rare in this population. Although no travel health vaccine is cost beneficial, most professionals will offer protection against the frequent risks, while most would find it ridiculous to use all available vaccines in every traveller. It is essentially an arbitrary decision made on the risk level one wishes to recommend protection--but the priorities need to be set correctly.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12615383"

The current control methods, which include the use of toxic acaricides to kill ticks, and the virulent sporozoite infection and treatment method have limitations. Recombinant vaccines, currently in their experimental stages, offer hope for the future. The use of acaricides is hampered by the development of acaricide resistance and live vaccines are dependent on cold chain facilities, which are a formidable obstacle in the poorly developed infrastructure in parts of Zambia where the vaccine is most needed. Amidst these drawbacks are the results of the recent research on parasites and vector recombinant vaccines which promise to circumvent these problems. The history, current status and attitudes regarding the control of these diseases, taking into account their complexity, are reviewed. The establishment of the well-designed Central Veterinary Research Institute (CVRI) and Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) sponsored veterinary school, both have a potential for high quality research, with access to a wealth of specimens a veritable goldmine of research material.

Its replacement depends on the immediate accessibility of effective affordable alternative treatment with tissue culture vaccines (TCVs). The use of the expensive European TCVs has been possible in Asia by means of economical intradermal (ID) post-exposure vaccine regimens. Implementation of this effective economical treatment has been delayed by the complexity and inconvenience of the regimens, and the reluctance to change prophylaxis against a fatal disease. Up to now, the ID regimens have been used only where passive immunisation with rabies immune globulin (RIG) is usually available. Rabies deaths despite optimal vaccine treatment have been attributed to lack of RIG. The ID regimens might soon be promoted in areas where RIG is not even available for severe exposure. It is therefore vital that economical vaccine regimens should be used which induce protective immunity rapidly. Improvements in rabies pet in developing countries could be made by: (i). publicising the urgency and efficacy of wound cleaning; (ii). facilitating the replacement of nervous tissue vaccines by economical ID treatment with TCVs; (iii). using an ID regimen with a large dose of vaccine on the first day of treatment especially when no RIG is available; and (iv). promoting pre-exposure prophylaxis to eliminate the need for RIG and provide better rabies prophylaxis.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=12531345"

This recommendation is based on the fact that, while more than 80% of cases of hepatitis A occurring in children less than 5 years of age are asymptomatic, infected children without jaundice can shed the virus and serve as a source of infection for others. Immunization of children traveling to endemic areas protects the whole family from secondary infection that often leads to severe manifestations. Because the cost of the vaccine is not covered by health insurance, African families living in France must have children vaccinated in advance before travel to Africa. Vaccination early in childhood is possible since the protective effect is durable and perhaps definitive. The dramatic decrease of incidence in France has eliminated the need for routine vaccination except in children traveling to international destinations. The main problem is prophylaxis around index cases in situations involving single family units, small closed communities and localized outbreaks. Immediate vaccination within 7 days after exposure to the index case should be considered since the immunoglobulins are not available in France. Limited trials in families and closed communities show that this vaccination approach is effective and well tolerated even by young children attending nurseries. However this indication is currently not recognized in France even though it has often been applied and has been recommended by the British advisory board. It is the responsibility of pediatricians to inform parents of this risk and propose individual prophylaxis for the family.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15615396"

Using the precedent established during the licensing of conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b and serogroup C meningococci and components of currently-licensed meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines, new meningococcal conjugate vaccines will likely be licensed using immunological endpoints as surrogates for clinical protection. Post-licensure evaluation of vaccine effectiveness will, therefore, be of increased importance.

A decision tree illustrates how these relationships were built into the DPP. This review concludes with a few lessons learned in providing medicines not only to South Africa, but also to the 77 other African countries now participating in the DPP. As the search for new treatments and vaccines continues, increasing access to existing medicines through targeted donations--including training and infrastructure support--is the most practical way for the health community to address the problem of ill health among the poor.

The economic cost of health care for children in IMCI and comparison districts was estimated through interviews and record review at national, district, facility, and household levels.FINDINGS: During the IMCI phase-in period, mortality rates in children under 5 years old were almost identical in IMCI and comparison districts. Over the next 2 years, the mortality rate was 13% lower in IMCI than in comparison districts (95% CI -7 to 30 or 5 to 21, depending on how adjustment is made for district-level clustering), with a rate difference of 3.8 fewer deaths per 1000 child-years. Contextual factors, such as use of mosquito nets, all favoured the comparison districts. Costs of children's health care with IMCI were similar to or lower than those for case-management without IMCI.INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that facility-based IMCI is good value for money, and support widespread implementation in the context of health-sector reform, basket funding, good facility access, and high utilisation of health facilities.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S014067360417311X"

Lee Willingham III from the WHO/FAO Collaborating Center for Research and Training on Emerging and other Parasitic Zoonoses in Denmark and Peter M. Schantz from the Parasitic Diseases Division of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. The focus was on the persistence of the zoonotic parasitic diseases cysticercosis, caused by the pork tapeworm T. solium, and echinococcosis,caused by species of the tapeworm Echinococcus, and why these diseases are given very little attention on the national and international agendas in spite of the availability of tools to detect, treat,control and prevent them when it is quite clear in most instances that they are clearly associated with and help perpetuate poverty. A major reason for this is that in many endemic areas the presence and impact of these diseases are not known due to the lack of investigation and information thus policymakers are not aware of their burden and benefits of their control. Documentation is also needed to help increase awareness of the international community and hopefully result in financial and technical support being made available. Thus, burden assessments of cysticercosis and echinococcosis provide an essential evidence base for securing political will and financial and technical support as well as providing a basis for cost-benefit analysis of prevention and control efforts. In order to make an appropriate and full burden assessment one must consider the health, agricultural, social and other impacts of these parasitic zoonoses comprehensively. During the symposium presentations were given concerning current ongoing initiatives to assess the burden of cysticercosis and echinococcosis and examples of the impact of these diseases in both developing and developed countries were provided. In addition, cost factors related to vaccines for these cestode diseases were discussed and the possibilities for technical and financial support from multilateral agencies for assessments and interventions presented.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24937886"

Efforts to develop newer vaccine technologies are currently underway, although with little success to date. This review examines the prospects of success for such approaches, and argues that alternative strategies, based upon simple and inexpensive changes to current vaccines and protocols are likely to prove far more effective in the foreseeable future. Such changes include the use of HEPES-buffer systems and the inclusion of pH indicators in vaccine media, together with restrictions in the use of 1M MgSO4 as a vaccine diluent. These changes can increase vaccine yields 10-fold and stability several 100-fold, increase the ease of production, provide a significant level of end user-enforceable quality control, and ultimately produce a vaccine which should prove effective in the field immediately.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(04)00378-0"

More than 1 million infants are born with congenital syphilis each year. Despite national policies on antenatal testing and the widespread use of antenatal services, syphilis screening is still implemented only sporadically in many countries, leaving the disease undetected and untreated among many pregnant women. The weak organization of services and the costs of screening are the principal obstacles facing programmes. Decentralization of antenatal syphilis screening programmes, on-site testing and immediate treatment can reduce the number of cases of congenital syphilis. Antenatal syphilis screening and treatment programmes are as cost effective as many existing public health programmes, e.g. measles immunization. Diagnosis of congenital syphilis is problematic since more than half of all infants are asymptomatic, and signs in symptomatic infants may be subtle and nonspecific. Newer diagnostic tests such as enzyme immunoassays, polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting have made diagnosis more sensitive and specific but are largely unavailable in the settings where they are most needed. Guidelines developed for better-resourced settings are conservative and err on the side of overtreatment. They are difficult to implement in, or inappropriate for, poorly-resourced settings because of the lack of investigative ability and the pressure on health facilities to discharge infants early. This paper offers recommendations for treating infants, including an approach based solely on maternal serological status and clinical signs of syphilis in the infant.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15356934"

Almost 3% of disability adjusted life years are due to malaria mortality globally, 10% in Africa. New information is presented in this supplement on malaria-related perinatal mortality, occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy, undernutrition, and neurologic, cognitive, and developmental sequelae. The entomologic determinants of transmission and uses of modeling for program planning and disease prediction and prevention are discussed. New data are presented from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe on the increasing urban malaria problem and on epidemic malaria. Between 6% and 28% of the malaria burden may occur in cities, which comprise less than 2% of the African surface. Macroeconomic projections show that the costs are far greater than the costs of individual cases, with a substantial deleterious impact of malaria on schooling of patients, external investments into endemic countries, and tourism. Poor populations are at greatest risk; 58% of the cases occur in the poorest 20% of the world's population and these patients receive the worst care and have catastrophic economic consequences from their illness. This social vulnerability requires better understanding for improving deployment, access, quality, and use of effective interventions. Studies from Ghana and elsewhere indicate that for every patient with febrile illness assumed to be malaria seen in health facilities, 4-5 episodes occur in the community. Effective actions for malaria control mandate rational public policies; market forces, which often drive sales and use of drugs and other interventions, are unlikely to guarantee their use. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria is rapidly gaining acceptance as an effective approach for countering the spread and intensity of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and other antimalarial drugs. Although costly, ACT ($1.20-2.50 per adult treatment) becomes more cost-effective as resistance to alternative drugs increases; early use of ACT may delay development of resistance to these drugs and prevent the medical toll associated with use of ineffective drugs. The burden of malaria in one district in Tanzania has not decreased since the primary health care approach replaced the vertical malaria control efforts of the 1960s. Despite decentralization, this situation resulted, in part, from weak district management capacity, poor coordination, inadequate monitoring, and lack of training of key staff. Experience in the Solomon Islands showed that spraying with DDT, use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and health education were all associated with disease reduction. The use of nets permitted a reduction in DDT spraying, but could not replace it without an increased malaria incidence. Baseline data and reliable monitoring of key outcome indicators are needed to measure whether the ambitious goals for the control of malaria and other diseases has occurred. Such systems are being used for evidence-based decision making in Tanzania and several other countries. Baseline cluster sampling surveys in several countries across Africa indicate that only 53% of the children with febrile illness in malarious areas are being treated; chloroquine (CQ) is used 84% of the time, even where the drug may be ineffective. Insecticide-treated bed nets were used only 2% of the time by children less than five years of age. Progress in malaria vaccine research has been substantial over the past five years; 35 candidate malaria vaccines are in development, many of which are in clinical trials. Development of new vaccines and drugs has been the result of increased investments and formation of public-private partnerships. Before malaria vaccine becomes deployed, consideration must be given to disease burden, cost-effectiveness, financing, delivery systems, and approval by regulatory agencies. Key to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness will be collection and prompt analysis of epidemiologic information. Training of persons in every aspect of malaria research and control is essential for programs to succeed. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is actively promoting research capacity strengthening and has established networks of institutions and scientists throughout the African continent, most of whom are now linked by modern information-sharing networks. Evidence over the past century is that successful control malaria programs have been linked to strong research activities. To ensure effective coordination and cooperation between the growing number of research and control coalitions forming in support of malaria activities, an umbrella group is needed. With continued support for scientists and control workers globally, particularly in low-income malarious countries, the long-deferred dream of malaria elimination can become a reality.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15331814"

A total of 80 (27 sick and 53 dead) birds 12-22 weeks old, were collected, autopsied and examined. The mortality rate was 46% for the first 14 weeks of the outbreak. Acute and chronic (classical) forms of the disease, the respective occurrence of which varied significantly (p&lt;0.01) in young (14.6% vs 85.4%) and adults (48.7% vs 51.31%) were manifested. All the autopsied birds had gross and microscopic lesions indicative of Marek's disease in the peripheral nerve(s) and/or visceral organs. Lesions involving peripheral nerves and visceral lymphomas were recorded mainly in adults (28/35, 80%) and young birds (34/45, 75%), respectively. These differences in the two age groups were statistically significant (p&lt;0.01). Young birds seem to be highly susceptible to the acute disease. Poor management, overstocking and lack of vaccination might have favoured the outbreak. Marek's disease causes considerable economic loss and is a major threat to poultry production in Ethiopia. This report emphasizes that Marek's disease should be considered as a disease of economic significance in chicken production in Ethiopia and warrants due attention.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15241973"

Input data were gleaned from the literature, from participatory appraisals, as well as a field study, spanning 12 months, of small-scale communal goat farming systems in Jericho in the Odi District of North West Province. The number of offspring weaned per annum, as a proportion of does owned, was selected as the desired output for analysis. This study has shown that small-scale communal goat farmers are not adopting or implementing extension messages to improve production capacity. In South Africa the majority of goats are slaughtered in the informal sector. If the informal sector is to be persuaded to market goats commercially through formal channels, then knowledge of the economics of goat farming on communal lands should be provided. The economic aspects of extension messages are probably an important factor in determining acceptance and sustainability yet appear to be seldom investigated. The probable reason for lack of adoption of standard extension messages, which promote improved nutrition, parasite control, vaccination and treatment of goats, was economic. In other words, the so-called 'poor management practices' used by communal farmers appeared to be economically more profitable than the 'good management practices' suggested to increase production. The price of communal goats was not related to their mass. A higher level of inputs would probably have resulted in a heavier kid, however it was established that this would not have influenced the price received as a majority of the goats were slaughtered for ritual purposes where age, colour and sex were more important to the purchaser than body mass. It is standard practice in commercial farming systems to evaluate the economic benefits of all management practices before they are implemented. Production animal veterinarians use veterinary economics to compare different scenarios to control diseases or select management practices in commercial herds. It is suggested that the inputs and outputs of small-scale farming systems should be carefully analysed and that veterinary economics should also be used to evaluate the probable impact of extension messages formulated by veterinarians and animal health technicians.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15214690"

Although all injections were given at the correct site, using the correct dosage and equipment, unsafe injection technique was observed. Needles were changed on the same syringe at 8 facilities (31%) and syringes and needles were reused at 2 facilities (8%). Recapping of needles after use occurred at 8 facilities (31%). More than one-quarter of nurses reported having pricked their finger in the previous 6 months; in almost half of these cases this was after administration of an injection. Seven nurses (25%) recalled seeing a case of an abscess or a mild adverse event following an injection in the previous 12 months.

Most of these countries affected by the epidemics met difficulties to set up the strategy recommended by the World Health Organization and which includes: Epidemiological surveillance and epidemic incidence threshold calculation to detect early meningitis epidemics and emergency vaccination campaigns with meningococcal A + C polysaccharide vaccine, if possible within the 4-to-6 weeks following the moment the threshold is reached. In this context of epidemics, notably in Mali, and in front of the risk of resurgence of yellow fever, the Ministry of Health of Senegal decided to conduct mass preventive immunization campaigns in 1997 against meningo- coccal meningitis and yellow fever in the districts located in the eastern part of the country and where emergency vaccination would have been difficult in case of epidemic because these area are difficult to reach. A short-term microeconomic evaluation of additional costs that are necessary to organize one of these mass preventive immunization campaigns was conducted in 1997 in the Matam District, in the Northeast part of Senegal. The method rested on value attribution and accounting procedure. The cost was defined as the monetary value of all mobilized resources to product the campaign corresponding to a plurality of charges and representing all of the effective expenses and donations. During this campaign, 85,925 people were vaccinated and a total number of 163,981 doses of both polysaccharide A + C meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines were administered within 3 weeks. Four intervention strategies were involved: Three for vaccination (mobile, fixed and outreach strategy) and one for coordination, information and training. The total cost of the campaign was 55,322.75 euros. Vaccines and solvents represented 60% of the total cost of the campaign, materiel for injection and safety of injection 26%, vaccination staff 7%, and logistics 7%. The mean cost was 0.34 euro per administered dose and 0.64 euro per vaccinee. The mean cost per administered dose of meningococcal vaccine was 0.44 euro. The mean cost of preventive meningococcal immunization was not higher than the mean cost of meningococcal vaccination during mass emergency immunization campaigns in other countries. The addition of yellow fever antigen brought down the campaign mean cost by 0.11 euro and it allowed economies of scales. Direct unit costs per administered dose were higher when people were vaccinated through the outreach strategy (0.35 euro) than when fixed and mobile strategies were used (0.318 and 0.323 euro, respectively). Costs related to transportation and staff were proportionally higher for the outreach strategy. Direct unit costs per administered dose were higher when vaccinations were done in rural areas (0.32 euro) than when done in urban areas (0.31 euro). Direct unit costs increased when the size of target communities decreased (in communities with less than 100 people to vaccinate versus 0.38 euro in communities with more than 2,000 people to vaccinate). This study allowed us to set up a method to measure, describe and analyze the costs of a mass preventive campaign. It demonstrated the economic impact of using multiple antigens during a single preventive campaign.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15047438"

None of the current screening methods comply with these prerequisites. More research is necessary into different combinations of tests, which improve sensitivity.

However patients in Africa have benefited little from progress in the field due to the lack of human and physical resources in sharp contrast with the high prevalence of the disease. The purpose of this study was to analyze problems involved in management of childhood sickle cell disease in Africa based on our experience in a cohort of 556 cases treated over a period of 12 years. The main problems were the same as those encountered in other black African nations, i.e., delayed diagnosis due to a lack of routine neonatal diagnostic screening, difficulty implementing anti-infectious prophylaxis due not only to the high cost of recommended vaccinations not covered by the Expanded Program on Immunization but also to poor compliance with antiobioprophylaxis, and insufficient transfusion facilities hindering application of long-term transfusion protocols when indicated. In addition the high prevalence of digestive-tract parasitosis and malaria raise the need to combine standard preventive measures with routine parasiticidal treatment and malarial prophylaxis adapted to each geographical area. The high frequency of associated iron deficiency requires systematic laboratory testing to identify and treat resulting manifestations during follow-up. An important prerequisite for widespread implementation of appropriate preventive and curative measures in Africa is recognition of sickle cell disease as a priority in public health care policy.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14763308"

Severe acute complications including cerebral malaria or materno-fetal death seem to be confined to areas of unstable transmission where malaria is uncommon except during epidemics. In areas of stable endemicity, the main consequences are maternal anemia and intra-uterine growth retardation resulting in low birthweight (LBW) particularly after first pregnancies. Recent studies have demonstrated that frequency and severity of placental malaria are greater in pregnant women with concurrent HIV infection. Since 1964 several controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate chemoprophylaxis in pregnant women mainly in tropical Africa where malaria transmission is stable. Findings have usually demonstrated an increase in mean birthweight after prophylaxis especially among primigravidae. Prophylaxis also had beneficial effects on anemia. Another finding of these trials was that prevention is less effective for women with HIV co-infection and that higher doses may therefore be required in such cases. In our opinion prophylaxis should be actively promoted as a routine public health measure for pregnant women in endemic areas. Current recommendations call for the use of a sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine twice or three times during pregnancy in antenatal clinics. This combination is more effective as a result of strong resistance of parasites to chloroquine. High cost and possible adverse effects in pregnant women prohibit routine use of mefloquine in developing countries. Integration of malaria prophylaxis into antenatal care services with nutrition and immunization measures should enhance the overall efficacy of prevention in outlying clinical facilities. Recent identification of molecular receptors involved in the cytoadherence of parasitized red blood cells to the placenta may lead to the development of new therapeutic or vaccinal approaches for pregnant women.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14763291"

Inaccessible, ownerless dogs, however, reduce the vaccination coverage achieved in parenteral campaigns. This study aimed to estimate the vaccination coverage in dogs in three study zones of N'Djaména, Chad, after a pilot free parenteral mass vaccination campaign against rabies. We used a capture-mark-recapture approach for population estimates, with a Bayesian, Markov chain, Monte Carlo method to estimate the total number of owned dogs, and the ratio of ownerless to owned dogs to calculate vaccination coverage. When we took into account ownerless dogs, the vaccination coverage in the dog populations was 87% (95% confidence interval (CI), 84-89%) in study zone I, 71% (95% CI, 64-76%) in zone II, and 64% (95% CI, 58-71%) in zone III. The proportions of ownerless dogs to owned dogs were 1.1% (95% CI, 0-3.1%), 7.6% (95% CI, 0.7-16.5%), and 10.6% (95% CI, 1.6-19.1%) in the three study zones, respectively. Vaccination coverage in the three populations of owned dogs was 88% (95% CI, 84-92%) in zone I, 76% (95% CI, 71-81%) in zone II, and 70% (95% CI, 66-76%) in zone III. Participation of dog owners in the free campaign was high, and the number of inaccessible ownerless dogs was low. High levels of vaccination coverage could be achieved with parenteral mass vaccination. Regular parenteral vaccination campaigns to cover all of N'Djaména should be considered as an ethical way of preventing human rabies when post-exposure treatment is of limited availability and high in cost.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14758434"

But the reality is that the vast majority of people living with HIV/AIDS still lack access to affordable, quality medicines. This article, a summary of a paper presented at &quot;Putting Third First: Vaccines, Access to Treatments and the Law,&quot; a satellite meeting held at Barcelona on 5 July 2002 and organized by the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, the AIDS Law Project, South Africa, and the Lawyers Collective HIV/AIDS Unit, India, explores three approaches for improving access. In the first part, Richard Elliott provides an overview of the state of the right to health as embodied in international human rights law; comments on the experience to date in litigating claims to the right to health; and identifies potential strategies activists can adopt to advance recognition of the right to health. In the second part, Sharan Parmar and Vivek Divan describe price-control and drug-financing mechanisms used by industrialized countries to increase the affordability of medicines; and discuss how some of these mechanisms could be adapted for use in developing countries.

For sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in particular, such as HIV, vaccine delivery in this (pre-sexually active) age group is going to be an integral component of the strategy to control these diseases in the future. Currently, however, adolescent vaccination does not routinely occur because the traditional method of delivery is through secondary schools, and in developing countries school attendance has historically been low. But with school attendance growing rapidly throughout the developing world, the cost of vaccines falling over time, and an increasing number of current and future vaccines targeted at adolescents, it is an ideal opportunity to place this route of delivery on the national and international health agenda. Therefore, this paper examines the rationale for adolescent vaccination, looks at the success of other adolescent-targeted health care interventions, and finally, considers the challenges associated with future adolescent vaccination programmes in developing countries.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14741173"

To define strategies to improve vaccine immunogenicity in early life, the role of genetic and environmental factors in the control of vaccine responses in infant twins was studied. Immune responses to BCG, polio, hepatitis B, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccines were measured at 5 months of age in 207 Gambian twin pairs recruited at birth. Intrapair correlations for monozygous and dizygous pairs were compared to estimate the environmental and genetic components of variation in responses. High heritability was observed for antibody (Ab) responses to hepatitis B (77%), oral polio (60%), tetanus (44%) and diphtheria (49%) vaccines. Significant heritability was also observed for interferon-gamma and interleukin-13 responses to tetanus, pertussis and some BCG vaccine antigens (39-65%). Non-HLA genes played a dominant role in responses to Ab-inducing vaccines, whereas responses to BCG were predominantly controlled by genes within the HLA class II locus. Genetic factors, particularly non-HLA genes, significantly modulate immune responses to infant vaccination. The identification of the specific genes involved will provide new targets for the development of vaccines and adjuvants for young infants that work independently of HLA.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14737096"

This study aimed to describe the number, nature, origin, clinical burden and cost of imported infections treated in infectious disease units (IDU) in England and Wales.METHOD: Information about all admissions in 1998 and 1999 with illnesses considered to have been acquired during their most recent travel abroad was collected retrospectively by IDUs using a pre-piloted questionnaire.RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: Four of the 23 IDUs in England and Wales were able to complete the questionnaires. They reported a total of 421 travel related admissions during the 2-year period. Three hundred and ninety-two of these cases were attributed to infectious causes, and of these a discharge diagnosis was made for 340 cases. The total number of bed days used to treat cases of imported infection was 2918. The most common diagnosis was malaria. The odds ratio that cases of imported infection were malaria was highest following visits to Africa. The average cost per bed day on the IDUs was around pound sterling 100, and on this basis, the total cost of treating imported infections on the four IDUs in 2 years was around pound sterling 289,000. The relative risk of acquiring an imported infection requiring treatment on an IDU was greatest for travellers to Africa.CONCLUSIONS: From this study, the estimate of the total annual cost of IDU treatment for imported infections in England and Wales is in excess of pound sterling 800,000. Many cases may be preventable with prophylactic medication and vaccination and travel advice on risk reduction. Further information about imported infections would be useful to inform travel medicine services, other clinicians and travellers about the health risks associated with travel to specific areas, and help to target and assess the cost effectiveness of preventative measures.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14720489"

The main comparison involved socio-demographic variables, events during pregnancy, obstetric outcome, child morbidity and mortality and care provided during an illness episode. Results showed that a significantly higher percentage of teenage mothers and their partners had lower educational achievement compared with adult mothers and their partners. They were more likely to be economically disadvantaged than the adult mothers. Teenage mothers and their parents were also less likely to have ever been married. The two groups of mothers were comparable in terms of the rate and timing of antenatal care visits, place of delivery, rate of operative deliveries, reported size of the baby at birth, child vaccination status and reported morbidity and health care practice during an illness episode. The index child was alive during the survey period for 89.4% of the teenage and 96.6% of the adult mothers (OR = 3.36; 95% CI = 1.34, 8.79; P = 0.004). Child survival rates in the two groups of mothers were found to be quite similar after controlled analysis for the influence of socio-economic factors. The study concluded that bad obstetric outcomes were not associated with maternal age. Although teenage and adult mothers were not significantly different on child health practices, children born to the former group died most frequently probably due to their poor socioeconomic achievements.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=14719414"

This study investigated the knowledge and perceptions of the informed consent process among individuals participating in influenza vaccine trials in two disadvantaged communities in South Africa.METHOD: Four to 12 months after completion of the trials, participants were contacted to return to participate in the informed consent study. The semistructured questionnaire administered to assess recall of trial procedures and the informed consent process covered key issues including: purpose of the study; awareness that the study was not part of routine treatment; voluntary nature of participation and freedom to withdraw; randomisation; placebos; and remuneration.RESULTS: A total of 334 participants (93% of the original vaccine trial sample; mean age 68 years, median level of education grade 8, 69% women) completed the questionnaire. Only 21% were able to recall that they were allocated randomly to the different treatment arms. Only 19% of those involved in the placebo controlled study had interpreted the concept of placebo as an inactive medication.CONCLUSION: Although a good general recall of trial concepts was demonstrated, only a small proportion of the participants correctly interpreted and recalled the concepts of randomisation and placebos. Informed consent in this and similarly disadvantaged communities may often be inadequate and new ways to improve understanding of the research process should be explored.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31/12/727"

Equity differentials for six child health indicators (underweight, stunting, measles immunization, access to treated and untreated nets, treatment of fever with antimalarial) improved significantly in IMCI districts compared with comparison districts (p&lt;0.05), while four indicators (wasting, DPT coverage, caretakers' knowledge of danger signs and appropriate careseeking) improved significantly in comparison districts compared with IMCI districts (p&lt;0.05). The largest improvements were observed for stunting among children between 24-59 months of age. The concentration index improved from -0.102 in 1999 to -0.032 in 2002 for IMCI, while it remained almost unchanged -0.122 to -0.133 in comparison districts. IMCI was associated with improved equity for measles vaccine coverage, whereas the opposite was observed for DPT antigens. This study has shown how equity assessments can be incorporated in impact evaluation at relatively little additional cost, and how this may point to specific interventions that need to be reinforced. The introduction of IMCI led to improvements in child health that did not occur at the expense of equity.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20/suppl_1/i77"

Household (HH) cost of ITNs is an important barrier to their uptake. We investigated the coverage, equity and cost of linking distribution of free ITNs to a measles vaccination campaign. During a national measles vaccination campaign in Zambia, children in four rural districts were given a free ITN when they received their measles vaccination. In one urban district, children were given a voucher, which could be redeemed for a net at a commercial distribution site. About 1700 HHs were asked whether they received vaccination and an ITN during a measles campaign, as well as questions on assets (e.g. type roofing material or bicycle ownership) to assess HH wealth. Net ownership was calculated for children in each wealth quintile.

Consequently, there is little demand for the highly effective PCV outside the United States and Europe. In Kenya, diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults was achieved with a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.98 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) of paired plasma samples for immunoglobulin G (IgG) to pneumococcal surface adhesin A (PsaA). We aimed to validate the same technique in children. We assayed paired blood samples from 98 children with IPD, 95 age-matched children with malaria/anemia, and 97 age-matched healthy controls by using an ELISA for anti-PsaA IgG. Sensitivity and specificity were determined in IPD patients and healthy controls. Specificity (0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 0.99) and sensitivity (0.42; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.52) were optimized at a 2.7-fold rise in anti-PsaA antibody concentration. Sensitivity was improved to a maximum of 0.50 by restricting testing to children of &lt;2 years old, by excluding IPD patients who were not sampled on the first day of presentation, and by incorporating high existing antibody concentrations in the analysis. Assay performance was independent of nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci at recruitment. This assay improves on existing diagnostic tools for IPD in children but would still leave over half of all cases undetected in epidemiological studies.

Mortality risk due to anaplasmosis was 0.046 in immunised and 0.018 in non-immunised cattle and this difference was statistically significant (chi(2)=4.48; P=0.043). The theileriosis mortality risk was 0.203 in the non-immunised cattle, while the risk was 0.009 in the immunised cattle and these differences were also significant (chi(2)=103; P=0.000). It was concluded that farmers who have immunised their cattle may cautiously cut down acaricide application by 50% for extensively grazed herds and by 75% for zero grazed animals depending on the level of tick challenge at the herd level.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S1090-0233(05)00207-8"

Variables explored were rating of quality of services, level of satisfaction with the services and willingness to pay for quality improvements as well as ability to pay for services.SETTING: Oji-river local government area of Enugu State, Nigeria.SUBJECTS: A random sample of 405 households from a sample frame of primary health care house numbers and another purposive sample of women and males were involved.RESULTS: Most respondents (90.6%) rated the services to be at least good. Another 95.9%, 94.3% and 95.8% of the respondents were, satisfied with the childhood immunisation, antenatal care and childbirth services respectively. Eighty nine percent of respondents were willing to pay for health services if drugs were readily available, while 92.4% would pay if there is overall improvement in quality. Majority of them were also able to pay for services. However, long waiting queues, providers' behaviours and lack of doctors militated against the utilisation of maternal and child health services.CONCLUSION: Bamako initiative programme improved drug availability and physical appearance of the health centres thereby leading to high levels of consumer satisfaction and people are willing and able to pay for primary health care services if there are quality improvements, as the Bamako initiative achieved. Continuous improvement of services, especially constant drug availability would motivate people to pay for services.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16167676"

The geographic distribution of the virus has been defined, with Japan, Africa, Caribbean islands and South America emerging as the areas of highest prevalence. The reasons for HTLV-I clustering, such as the high ubiquity in southwestern Japan but low prevalence in neighboring regions of Korea, China and eastern Russia are still unknown. The major modes of transmission are well understood, although better quantitative data on the incidence of transmission, and on promoting/inhibiting factors, are needed. Epidemiologic proof has been obtained for HTLV-I's causative role in major disease associations: adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), HTLV-associated uveitis and infective dermatitis. However, more and better studies are needed for other apparent disease outcomes such as rheumatologic, psychiatric and infectious diseases. Since curative treatment of ATL and HAM/TSP is lacking and a vaccine is unavailable, the social and financial cost for the individual, his/her family and the health system is immense. For this reason, public health interventions aimed at counseling and educating high-risk individuals and populations are of paramount importance.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1208968"

No alternative screening method seems to be clearly advantageous. Although combinations of tests have higher sensitivities, they are complex, costly and associated with low specificities. Adding the problem of effective treatment, it seems that mass screening with adequate coverage of the population is an unreachable goal for many developing countries.

In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs have dramatically improved the health and extended the lives of people with HIV/AIDS. However, their high cost of implementation and demanding clinical requirements put them out of reach of the vast majority of people with HIV, especially in developing countries where HIV infection levels are high and public resources are extremely scarce. With 25.4 million people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa as of the end of 2004 (http://www.unaids.org), this region was still by far the worst-affected in the world with HIV-1 subtype C (HIV-1C) accounting for the majority of infections. Although the constraints placed by HIV genetic variation on vaccine efficacy remain unclear, there is an indication that they may be important and several candidate vaccines targeting HIV-1C are currently under investigation in both pre-clinical and clinical settings. The designs of these candidate HIV-1C vaccines focus on both regulatory and structural HIV-1 proteins derived from HIV-1C. They make use of a number of current vaccine technologies for their delivery to invoke adaptive immune responses in individuals that hopefully may prove to be protective. This review looks at the progress and accomplishments made thus far in the generation and testing of such HIV-1C vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(05)00792-9"

This decision to develop rotavirus vaccines is predicated on the great burden associated with fatal rotavirus disease (i.e., 440,000 deaths/year), the firm scientific basis for developing live oral vaccines, the belief that increased investment in development at this time could speed the introduction of vaccines in developing countries, and the appreciation that implementation of a vaccine program should result in a measurable decrease in the number of hospitalizations and deaths associated with rotavirus disease within 2-3 years. RotaShield (Wyeth-Ayerst), the first rotavirus vaccine licensed in the United States, was withdrawn after 9 months because of a rare association of the vaccine with the development of intussusception. In the developing world, this vaccine could still have had a measurable effect, because the benefits of preventing deaths due to rotavirus disease would have been substantially greater than the rare risk of intussusception. Two live oral vaccines being prepared by GlaxoSmithKline and Merck have completed large-scale clinical trials. The GlaxoSmithKline vaccine has been licensed in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, and the Merck vaccine could be licensed in the United States within 1 year; several other candidate vaccines are in earlier stages of testing. However, many challenges remain before any of these vaccines can be incorporated into childhood immunization programs in the developing world. First, vaccine efficacy, which has already been demonstrated in children in industrialized and middle-income countries, needs to be proven in poor developing countries in Africa and Asia. The safety of vaccines with regard to the associated risk of intussusception must be demonstrated as well. Novel financing strategies will be needed to ensure that new vaccines are affordable and available in the developing world. Decision makers and parents in developing countries need to know about this disease that has little name recognition and is rarely diagnosed. Finally, for the global effort toward the prevention of rotavirus disease to be successful, special efforts will be required in India, China, and Indonesia, because one-third of all deaths due to rotavirus disease occur in these countries, and because these countries depend almost entirely on vaccines manufactured domestically.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=JID33222"

The human population at risk from endemic canine rabies was predicted using data on dog density, and human rabies deaths were estimated using a series of probability steps to determine the likelihood of clinical rabies developing in a person after being bitten by a dog suspected of having rabies. Model outputs on mortality and morbidity associated with rabies were used to calculate an improved disability-adjusted life year (DALY) score for the disease. The total societal cost incurred by the disease is presented.FINDINGS: Human mortality from endemic canine rabies was estimated to be 55 000 deaths per year (90% confidence interval (CI) = 24 000-93 000). Deaths due to rabies are responsible for 1.74 million DALYs lost each year (90% CI = 0.75-2.93). An additional 0.04 million DALYs are lost through morbidity and mortality following side-effects of nerve-tissue vaccines. The estimated annual cost of rabies is USD 583.5 million (90% CI = USD 540.1-626.3 million). Patient-borne costs for post-exposure treatment form the bulk of expenditure, accounting for nearly half the total costs of rabies.CONCLUSION: Rabies remains an important yet neglected disease in Africa and Asia. Disparities in the affordability and accessibility of post-exposure treatment and risks of exposure to rabid dogs result in a skewed distribution of the disease burden across society, with the major impact falling on those living in poor rural communities, in particular children.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0042-96862005000500012"

In Chad, the disease has been reported almost everywhere in the country and confirmed in several regions, but there are no control measures in place. A survey was conducted at three sites in south-eastern Chad in July and August 2001, based on face-to-face interviews with 20% of the peasant farmers keeping chickens at these sites. The aim was to collect information on peak epidemic periods and on ways in which the infection spreads. The survey revealed that the peak epidemic periods for Newcastle disease are April, during the mango harvesting and selling period, and December, when trade increases for the seasonal festivities. The survey also showed that peasant farmers attach great importance to chicken farming. The survey was followed by a vaccination trial in November 2001 and February 2002, using the La Sota strain administered ocularly. All of the birds vaccinated during the trial were successfully protected from the disease and both chicken production and the income of the villagers increased. The authors conclude that in order to sustain poultry farming and maximise production in the southern zone, vaccination programmes must be urgently introduced, campaigns to raise awareness of Newcastle disease should be carried out and financial support to pay for vaccines should be provided. Efforts to combat other causes of poultry mortality must also be undertaken.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15861872"

The interventions were three different coverage levels of mass vaccination and one surveillance-based programme where vaccination targeted infected sub-populations. For each scenario, the disease impact was estimated using an open-population, state-transition SEIR ('susceptible', 'exposed', 'infectious', 'recovered') disease transmission model with parameter estimates developed for lineage 1 rinderpest virus. Projected economic surplus gains and costs estimated from the rinderpest eradication programme in Ethiopia were analysed using benefit-cost methods. Social net present values (NPVs) and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) were calculated. Although the economic model found that BCRs were greater than one for all interventions examined, the scenarios of intensive mass vaccination (75% vaccination coverage) and surveillance with targeted vaccination were economically preferable. The BCRs for these strategies were 5.08 and 3.68, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that an increase in market prices for beef and milk increased the value of economic loss, the economic surplus and returns to investments in terms of NPVs and BCRs. An increase in demand and supply elasticities for beef and milk decreased the value of economic losses. This also had a negative effect on economic surplus and NPVs. The effect of an increase in the discount rate reduced returns to investments, with lower NPVs and BCRs. The authors note that 75% mass vaccination coverage was attempted in Ethiopia in the early 1990s, but failed to eradicate rinderpest because the approach was logistically too difficult to implement in practice. Subsequently, an effective surveillance and epidemiologically targeted vaccination programme was developed and has apparently resulted in the eradication of rinderpest from Ethiopia (the last case was recorded in 1996). The authors conclude that epidemio-surveillance with targeted vaccination is both an economically viable and realistic strategy and offers benefits that extend beyond rinderpest eradication.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15861869"

Effective vaccines have not been used routinely, due to perceived limitations of the duration of effectiveness as well as immunogenicity when administered during infancy. Given the sporadic nature of outbreaks, the optimal use of these vaccines to control both short-term epidemic and endemic meningococcal disease has been the subject of much debate. Seven economic studies on the use of polysaccharide vaccination strategies help to highlight the relevant epidemiological and economic issues surrounding the decisions for their use. Five of these studies were based in Africa, the region where annual incidence rates can be several orders of magnitude greater than the rest of the world. These studies demonstrated that vaccination against meningococcal disease during outbreak situations is suboptimal given the inability to rapidly immunise populations in a timely fashion in resource-poor areas. However, depending on the disease incidence and the ability to deliver vaccines, the polysaccharide vaccine can be cost effective for preventive strategies when given prior to the start of outbreaks, either through presumptive vaccination or through a modified routine delivery strategy. Economic analyses of mass immunisation campaigns and modelled routine vaccination suggest that routine use of meningococcal vaccines for preventive strategies could be within the range of cost-effective public health interventions in those regions of the world where meningococcal disease is endemic. This includes the meningococcal belt of Africa, the Sahelian region.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2344"

While the target population was willing to pay CFAfr 2101 for a vaccine against maternal malaria, its members were prepared to pay only CFAfr 1433 for a vaccine against childhood malaria.CONCLUSIONS: Whilst it is increasingly likely that anti-disease malaria vaccines will become available in the foreseeable future, lessons from the past suggest that a lack of acceptance and support from the intended recipients may lead to less than optimal compliance, and hence efficacy. For the planning of vaccine development and application strategies, it is therefore highly important to take community views into account.

Families with one or more children less than five years old were targeted to receive a free insecticide-treated bednet. The Ghana Health Service, with support from the Ghana Red Cross and UNICEF, provided logistical support, volunteer workers and social mobilization during the campaign. Volunteers visited homes to inform caregivers about the campaign and encourage them to participate. We assessed pre-campaign coverage of bednets by interviewing caregivers leaving vaccination and distribution sites. Five months after distribution, a two-stage cluster survey using population-proportional sampling assessed bednet coverage, retention and use. Both the pre-campaign and post-campaign survey assessed household wealth using an asset inventory.FINDINGS: At the campaign exit interview 636/776 (82.0%) caregivers reported that they had received a home visit by a Red Cross volunteer before the campaign and that 32/776 (4.1%) of the youngest children in each household who were less than 5 years of age slept under an insecticide-treated bednet. Five months after distribution caregivers reported that 204/219 (93.2%) of children aged 9 months to 5 years had been vaccinated during the campaign; 234/248 (94.4%) of households were observed to have an insecticide-treated bednet; and 170/249 (68.3%) were observed to have a net hung over a bed. Altogether 222/248 (89.5%) caregivers reported receiving at least one insecticide-treated bednet during the campaign, and 153/254 (60.2%) said that on the previous night their youngest child had slept under a bednet received during the campaign. For households in the poorest quintile, post-campaign coverage of insecticide-treated bednets was 10 times higher than pre-campaign coverage of households in the wealthiest quintile (46/51 (90.2%) versus 14/156 (9.0%)).

The objectives of the project were to provide human vaccination in conjunction with existing veterinary services, to evaluate the feasibility and limitations of such campaigns, to determine what other services could be provided concurrently, and to estimate the savings for public health care cases in comparison with carrying out vaccination separately. In a series of 12 vaccination campaigns in the Chari-Baguirmi and Kanem districts, more than 2100 children, 2100 women and 52000 cattle were fully immunized. These results confirmed the feasibility of joint campaigns in nomadic settings and provided important experience for improving organization. Information-Education-Communication (IEC) campaigns adapted to the realities of the pastoral setting were an important factor in mobilizing nomadic pastoralists for attendance at vaccination clinics. The savings in logistics costs (i.e., personnel, transportation and cold chain costs excluding vaccine costs) was 15% in Gredaya where 3 out of 6 campaigns were carried out together with veterinarians and 4% in Chaddra/Am Dobak where only 1 out of 6 campaigns was carried out in conjunction with veterinarians. The cost per fully immunized child (FIC) was considerably higher in Chaddra/Am Dobak than Gredaya (EUR 29.2 vs. EUR 11.5). The joint vaccination campaign approach is innovative, appreciated by nomadic pastoralists and less expensive than separate vaccination. By using the mobility of veterinarians in remote zones far from health care facilities, vaccination can be provided to nomadic children and women in countries with limited resources.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15771021"

Conditions in the southern African region are favourable for spiking FMD outbreaks due to Southern African Territories (SAT) serotypes, because of the co-existence of the agent, hosts and a conducive environment. In the past these parameters were less controlled and FMD outbreaks were common in the region, causing tremendous social and economic losses. The inception of conventional FMD vaccines in the region in the 1970s led to a significant improvement in the control of the disease. Vaccination used with other appropriate strategies has been the cornerstone of FMD control strategy in Botswana. FMD vaccine used in Botswana is manufactured locally; it is effective and has been responsible for the elimination of FMD outbreaks since the early eighties. FMD vaccination is a costly exercise. The programme has been sustained for decades because there is political will and financial support from government. However, its economic value can only be determined through a cost-benefit analysis, which is not a subject of this paper. The experience of FMD control in Botswana, with special reference to vaccination, is discussed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15742653"

Participants All 10 PHC facilities in Calabar, 252 PHC workers serving in the facilities, and 76 mothers whose children received care in the facilities.OUTCOME MEASURES: Adequacy of structure (equipment and personnel); process (diagnosis, training and knowledge, use of national case-management algorithm, and supervision), and output (clients' satisfaction).MAIN RESULTS: PHC facilities were adequately equipped to the extent of providing immunization services and management of diarrhoea but not for other aspects of care expected of a PHC centre, including management of acute respiratory infections (ARI), a common problem in children in the region. Supply of essential drugs was inadequate in all centres and facilities for emergency care were lacking. Many of the health care workers (68.3%) had adequate training in immunization, and their knowledge scores on immunization issues (62%) was higher than in other aspect of PHC. Use of the national case management algorithm was low among PHC workers. Results of the focus group discussions with mothers showed that a few perceived quality of care to be poor. The main concerns were long waiting time, lack of essential drugs, and attitude of the health workers.CONCLUSIONS: Inadequacy in the quality of child health services in PHC facilities is a product of failures in a range of quality measures -- structural (lack of equipment and essential drugs), process failings (non-use of the national case management algorithm and lack of a protocol of systematic supervision of health workers). Efforts to improve the quality of child health services provided by PHC workers in the study setting and similar locales in less developed countries should focus not only on resource-intensive structural improvements, but also on cheap, cost-effective measures that address actual delivery of services (process), especially the proper use of national guidelines for case management, and meaningful supervision.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=CCH493"

In the absence of appropriate policy and programme action, VAD will be the attributable cause of over 30,000 deaths annually in the under-5s. This represents 34.8% of all-cause mortality in this age group.DISCUSSION: Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) has been adopted as a short- to medium-term strategy to control VAD in children, and is integrated into routine child health services. However, the last VAS coverage survey showed that only 46% of children received a vitamin A supplement in the 6 months preceding the survey. If VAS coverage is to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, four areas appear to be of paramount importance: (1) reduce missed opportunities for VAS such as visits of sick children to child health services and community outreach activities; (2) take advantage of all potential opportunities for accelerating VAS coverage, such as additional vaccination campaigns and emergency response activities; (3) strengthen health workers' training, supervision and monitoring skills; and (4) increase community demand for VAS of children. Biannual VAS, as the primary component of an integrated strategy for VAD control in children, has the promise to be among the most cost-effective/high-impact child survival interventions in Mozambique.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15705242"

This model was developed for the WHO to estimate the global burden of disease from hepatitis B. Cost data of vaccine delivery and medical treatment related to hepatitis B infection were collected for the analysis.FINDINGS: The introduction of hepatitis B vaccine has increased the annual budget for immunization services by approximately 56%. It is predicted that more than 4000 future deaths are averted annually by the intervention. In the base case scenario, the incremental costs per undiscounted deaths averted amount to US$436, and the costs per undiscounted DALY averted amount to US$36. Since the major impact of hepatitis B vaccination will not start to be evident for at least another 40 years (deaths from hepatitis B mainly occur between 40-60 years of age), the cost per DALY averted rises to US$47, when using a discount rate of 3% on health effects. We found that the monovalent hepatitis B vaccine was considerably more cost-effective than the hepatitis B vaccine in combination with DTP.INTERPRETATION: If policy makers value future health benefits equal to current benefits, the cost-effectiveness of infant hepatitis B vaccination is in the range of other primary health care interventions for which similar analysis has been undertaken.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20/1/50"

This paper describes validation of sandwich and capture enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) based on gamma-irradiated antigens for the detection of RVFV-specific IgG and IgM antibody in humans. Validation data sets derived from testing field-collected sera from Africa (n=2400) were dichotomised according to the results of a virus neutralisation test. In addition, sera from laboratory workers immunized with inactivated RVF vaccine (n=93) and serial sera (n=3) from a single RVF case were used. ELISA data were expressed as percentage of high-positive control serum (PP). Cut-off values at 95% accuracy level were optimised using the misclassification cost term option of the two-graph receiver operating characteristics analysis. During the routine use of assays there was no evidence for excessive intra- and inter-plate variations within and between runs of assays. At a cut-off of 13.2 PP the sensitivity of the IgG-sandwich ELISA was 100% and specificity 99.95%, while for the IgM-capture ELISA the values were 96.47 and 99.44%, respectively, at a cut-off of 7.1 PP. Compared to the virus neutralisation test, the IgG-sandwich ELISA was more sensitive in detection of immunological responses in vaccines. Following natural infection class-specific antibodies were detected in serum taken 6 days after onset of symptoms. The results demonstrate that both assays will be useful for early diagnosis of infection, epidemiological surveillance and for monitoring of immune response after vaccination. As highly accurate, robust and safe tests, they have the potential to replace traditional diagnostic methods which are unable to distinguish between different classes of immunoglobulins, and pose health risks necessitating their use being restricted to high containment facilities outside RVF endemic areas.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0166-0934(04)00372-6"

PAL+ aims at bringing out: 1) conditions to promote novel preventive and therapeutic tools adapted to existing situations in the countries concerned; 2) a contribution to help research teams in Southern countries become competitive. PAL+ plans to strengthen cooperative relationships with developing countries (subsaharian Africa, South East Asia and South American countries). Research programs were oriented towards public health needs in malaria-endemic countries and thus mainly focused on: i) development of new antimalarial drugs and new therapeutical strategies: new targets and new leads for drugs, clinical assays for recognition of malaria and optimization of effective treatment or prophylactic drug dosage; ii) pathophysiology of severe malaria: mechanisms of immunity, biology and genome of host and parasite and research leading to vaccine trials; iii) basic and field research on mosquito genetics and biology which may lead to new prevention and control opportunities; iv) social studies on behaviours and habits around prevention and medication of malaria. The objective is to help Southern countries increase their capacity in clinical research, epidemiology, therapeutics, public health and social science (e.g. behaviours and habits accompanying medicine-taking). This means a true partnership and training adapted to specific needs and based on sound science. Research was therefore largely pursued in the laboratories of Southern countries and PAL+ supported the initiative in different ways by: i) providing easier opportunities for scientists from the North to collaborate with scientists from the South; ii) supporting networks of scientist collaborations. This was achieved by setting up a new type of relationships between scientists, based on a continuous dialogue and on bringing them together in small meetings on thematic discussions, the so-called Ateliers de PAL+. The Ateliers should play a major role in increasing the scientific capacity in developing countries. PAL+ program is a commitment to speed up better understanding of the disease by helping endemic countries contribute to research for their own benefit.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15662937"

The 1998 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey and the 2000 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey are the main sources of household-level data. These surveys are supplemented by data from a 2002 survey of health facilities conducted in three provinces. At the national level, immunization financing data were collected from the Ministry of Health and donors that support the national Expanded Programme on Immunization.FINDINGS: The 1998 survey found that nationally 37% of children were fully immunized; the 2000 survey found that nationally 34% were fully immunized. These results are strongly correlated with both the mother's level of education and the household's economic status. Multilevel logistic regression shows that maternal education level is a stronger predictor of positive immunization status than is relative economic status. Children of mothers with secondary education or higher education were 3 times more likely to be fully vaccinated than children whose mothers had not completed primary education. At the health-facility level, both having art immunization plan and regular supervisory visits from someone at the health-district level are strongly positively associated with immunization rates. The cost of routine vaccinations for each fully immunized child is 12.73 U.S. dollars when donors' contributions are included but not the costs of immunization campaigns.CONCLUSION: Studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s found that costs per fully immunized child varied from 2.19 U.S. dollars to 26.59 U.S. dollars (not adjusted for inflation) in a range of low-income and middle-income countries. The relatively low rates of immunization coverage in Cameroon, and the strong influence of the household's socioeconomic status--particularly the mother's level of education--on immunization rates suggest that the effectiveness of the Cameroon programme could be increased by promoting immunization and directing such programmes towards households with limited resources.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15628204"

Producing a vaccine that could be effective in low-income regions requires new kinds of initiatives that can coordinate research nationally and globally, and circumvent current regulatory mechanisms that dictate against the development and dissemination of low-profit medical technologies.

We report impact of a change in programmatic delivery strategy from routine delivery through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI+) approach to twice-yearly mass distribution campaigns on coverage of vitamin A supplementation in TanzaniaMETHODS: We investigated disparities in age, sex, socio-economic status, nutritional status and maternal education within vitamin A coverage in children between 1 and 2 years of age from two independent household level child health surveys conducted (1) during a continuous universal targeting scheme based on routine EPI contacts for children aged 9, 15 and 21 months (1999); and (2) three years later after the introduction of twice-yearly vitamin A supplementation campaigns for children aged 6 months to 5 years, a 6-monthly universal targeting scheme (2002). A representative cluster sample of approximately 2,400 rural households was obtained from Rufiji, Morogoro Rural, Kilombero and Ulanga districts. A modular questionnaire about the health of all children under the age of five was administered to consenting heads of households and caretakers of children. Information on the use of child health interventions including vitamin A was asked.RESULTS: Coverage of vitamin A supplementation among 1-2 year old children increased from 13% [95% CI 10-18%] in 1999 to 76% [95%CI 72-81%] in 2002. In 2002 knowledge of two or more child health danger signs was negatively associated with vitamin A supplementation coverage (80% versus 70%) (p = 0.04). Nevertheless, we did not find any disparities in coverage of vitamin A by district, gender, socio-economic status and DPT vaccinations.CONCLUSION: Change in programmatic delivery of vitamin A supplementation was associated with a major improvement in coverage in Tanzania that was been sustained by repeated campaigns for at least three years. There is a need to monitor the effect of such campaigns on the routine health system and on equity of coverage. Documentation of vitamin A supplementation campaign contacts on routine maternal and child health cards would be a simple step to facilitate this monitoring.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1472-6963-6-142"

We examined the cost-effectiveness of providing first-line treatment for male trichomoniasis in Malawi, a condition not commonly considered in syndromic management throughout sub-Saharan Africa.METHODS: We used decision tree analysis to assess program costs and outcomes among a 1-year population of male sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attendees estimated at 10,000 in Lilongwe. Our main outcomes were program costs from the government perspective and HIV infections averted. We conducted univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses on selected parameters.RESULTS: In our study population of male STD clinic attendees with an HIV prevalence of 44% and a Trichomonas vaginalis prevalence of 20%, including universal metronidazole as a first-line treatment for trichomoniasis at $0.05 per dose would increase program costs by $277 (year 2000 US dollars) and avert 23 cases of HIV. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over the current STD management guidelines was $15.42 per case of HIV averted. The number of HIV infections averted under sensitivity analysis ranged from 2 to 52, with attendant ICERs varying from cost savings to $162.92. Consideration of wider social benefits, such as the costs of HIV infections to the individual or the government, would further enhance the cost-effectiveness of this program.CONCLUSIONS: As part of a larger program to control STDs, incorporating metronidazole to treat male trichomoniasis could represent a cost-effective means to reduce HIV transmission in this high-risk group.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/01.qai.0000229014.39451.33"

The average cost per FIC increases almost linearly from US 4.2 dollars per FIC at a vaccine price of US 1 dollars per dose to US 31.2 dollars at vaccine price of US 10 dollars per dose. The marginal cost is approximately 5% less than the average cost. Although the vaccine price still determines most of the total delivery costs, the analysis shows that other costs are relevant and should be taken into account before marketing the vaccine and planning its inclusion into the EPI.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=75/2_suppl/119"

The models provide a unique platform for predicting both the short- and long-term effects of malaria vaccines on the burden of disease, allowing for the temporal dynamics of effects on immunity and transmission. We discuss how the models can be used to obtain robust cost-effectiveness estimates for a wide range of malaria vaccines and vaccination delivery strategies in different eco-epidemiologic settings.

The entire project will include household and provider tangible COI, whereas this article concentrates on the development of a provider cost information system in rural first-line health facilities.METHOD: Special forms and reports are prepared to routinely collect capital and recurrent costs of first-line facilities. Inventory lists are designed, and buildings and equipment are assessed by engineers. Total, fixed, variable and average costs are calculated for 15 rural health centres with five cost centres: general outpatient consultation, ambulatory nursing care, deliveries, immunization and other services (neonatal consultation, child care and family planning).RESULTS: In 2003, the average costs per service unit were 1.34 US$ for a general consultation, 0.51 US$ for ambulatory nursing care, 6.73 US$ per delivery, 3.64 US$ per vaccination and 1.11 US$ per service unit of other care. On average, a health centre consumes 29,900 US$ per year for a catchment population of 10,000 inhabitants.CONCLUSIONS: The major share of costs is fixed and does not depend on the workload of the health centre. Consequently, the costs of first-line facilities will hardly increase if the demand for health services rises. These findings can be used to improve the health financing in Nouna health district, Burkina Faso.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=TMI1691"

In areas where exemption exists, these are largely unofficial, as no official documents exist to support exemption. A total of 1594 individuals were surveyed. Community members prefer pregnant women, children and patients with TB, malaria, onchocerciasis and leprosy to be exempted from payment of fees: decision makers prefer the poor, children and patients with malaria, TB and leprosy to be exempted from payment for drugs, registration, consultation and preventive services such as immunization and antenatal services.

Information was collected from parents of eligible children by semi-structured questionnaires and observation of the children and their parents while on admission and at home. Of the 51 couples who met the study criteria, there were 27 seroconcordant couples and 24 serodiscordant couples. The children from serodiscordant couples were more frequently discharged against medical advice, abandoned, lost to follow-up, cared for by their mothers alone and were not up-to-date with their immunization schedule when compared with children from seroconcordant parents. These were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). There was a higher mortality among these children and their mothers (p &lt; 0.05). Paternal reasons for not providing adequate care for the children from serodiscordant parents included fear of being infected, doubt of child's paternity and waste of family resources on a 'child who is dying'. None of the children from both groups received support from governmental and non-governmental agencies. It is concluded that the care of sick HIV seropositive children of serodiscordant parents poses special challenges for clinicians working in Nigeria where there is no social support system.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=W05847127L25187G"

We assessed vaccination coverage and cost, showing the cost per dog vaccinated for the public sector and for society. An extrapolation to city level calculated the approximate cost of vaccinating all 23 600 dogs in N'Djaména. In the pilot mass campaign with 3000 dogs the average cost per dog was 1.69 euro. to the public and the full societal cost was 2.45 euro. If all 23 600 dogs in N'Djaména were vaccinated, the average cost would fall to 1.16 euro to the public and 1.93 euro to society. Private sector costs account for 31% of the cost to vaccinate 3000 dogs, and 40% of the cost to vaccinate 23 600 dogs. Mass dog vaccination could be a comparatively cheap and ethical way to both control the disease in animals and prevent human cases and exposure, especially in developing countries.

The costs of introducing IPV in a separate vial as well as in different combination vaccines were estimated, and IPV schedules with 2, 3 and 4 doses were compared with the current 6-dose OPV schedule. Assumptions about IPV prices were based on indications from vaccine manufacturers. The health impact of OPV cessation was measured in terms of vaccine associated paralytic paralysis (VAPP) cases and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted.CONCLUSIONS: The use of OPV in routine immunization services is predicted to result in 2.96 VAPP cases in the 2005 cohort. The cost-effectiveness of the different IPV alternatives varies between US$ 740,000 and US$ 7.2 million per VAPP case averted. The costs per discounted DALY averted amount to between US$ 61,000 and US$ 594,000. Among the IPV strategies evaluated, the 2-dose schedule in a 10-dose vial is the most cost-effective option. At the assumed vaccine prices, all IPV options do not appear to be cost-effective in the South African situation. OPV cessation without IPV replacement would result in cost savings of US$ 1.6 million per year compared to the current situation. This is approximately a 9% decrease in the budget for vaccine delivery in South Africa. However, with this option there is a risk (albeit small) of vaccine-derived poliovirus circulating in a progressively susceptible population. For IPV in a single dose vial, the break-even price, at which the costs of IPV delivery equal the current OPV delivery costs, is US$ 0.39.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(06)00589-5"

However, confirmed cases of wild polio virus continue to be reported from Northern Nigeria. This paper examines the reasons for the difficulties in eradicating polio in Northern Nigeria from the perspective of residents of one town, Zaria, in northern Kaduna State. Research methods included participant observation, open-ended interviews and the collection of polio-related documents. While some people believed that the vaccine was contaminated by anti-fertility substances, others questioned the focus on polio when measles and malaria were considered more harmful. Some also distrusted claims about the safety of Western biomedicine. These concerns relate to questions about the appropriateness of vertical health interventions, where levels of routine immunization are low. While the Polio Eradication Initiative was considered to be cost-effective by Western donors, from the perspective of some people in Zaria it was seen as undermining primary health care, suggesting that a collaborative, community-based framework for primary health care, which includes routine immunization, would be a more acceptable approach.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0277-9536(06)00224-3"

In this chapter, the history of the control of schistosomiasis is briefly discussed and current methods of control of schistosomiasis are reviewed; including mollusciciding, biological control of the intermediate snail hosts, the development of drugs to kill the adult worms, provision of clean water and health education, with a focus on the African situation. Since an effective vaccine against schistosomiasis is lacking, the emphasis today is placed on the drug praziquantel (PZQ). The marked reduction in the cost of PZQ together with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has enabled the drug to be used more widely in sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, with the possibility of resistance to praziquantel emerging, the potential role of other drugs, such as artemether, in the control of schistosomiasis is examined. The World Health Organization (WHO) anticipates that at least 75% of all schoolchildren at risk of morbidity from schistosomiasis will be treated by 2010, with the aim of reversing morbidity. The importance of recent international initiatives such as the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) working in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Zambia, Tanzania and Uganda is recognised. There are benefits to integrating the control of schistosomiasis with other disease control programmes, such as gastrointestinal helminths and/or lymphatic filariasis (LF), since this markedly reduces the cost of delivery of the treatment. Countries that are situated on the perimeter of the distribution of schistosomiasis have either achieved or have made progress towards the elimination of the disease. For control programmes to be successful in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, it is absolutely essential that these programmes are sustainable. Thus, it will be vital for Ministries of Health and Education to budget for the control of diseases of poverty in addition to school health, and to utilise funds from a range of sources, such as, government funds, pooled donor contributions, or bilateral and international agencies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0065-308X(05)61013-5"

Yet a decade later, coverage is still unacceptably low: only 3% of African children are currently sleeping under an ITN, and only about 20% are sleeping under any kind of net. This review charts the scientific, policy and programmatic progress of ITNs over the last 10 years. Available evidence for the range of programmatic delivery mechanisms used at country level is presented alongside the key policy debates that together have contributed to the evolution of ITN delivery strategies over the past decade. There is now global consensus around a strategic framework for scaling up ITN usage in Africa, which recognizes a role for both the public sector (targeting vulnerable groups to promote equity) and the private sector (sustainable supply). So, while progress with increasing coverage to date has been slow, there is now global support for the rapid scale-up of ITNs among vulnerable groups by integrating ITN delivery with maternal and child health programmes (and immunization in particular), at the same time working with the private sector in a complementary and supportive manner to ensure that coverage can be maintained for future generations of African children.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0065-308X(05)61003-2"

It focuses on the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratories in The Gambia and particularly their Pneumococcal Vaccine Trial (PVT) that was conducted jointly with the Gambian government during 2001-2004. In many respects this was an exemplar of international best practice in trial communication and informed consent procedures. Yet ethnographic and survey research finds that Gambian parents' perspectives on participation are shaped not by trial specificities, but by broader, historically shaped views and experiences of the MRC as an institution. There is a pervasive view that the MRC offers good, free medication to participants, but that it also 'steals blood'. Widespread concerns with blood-stealing emerge from local frames of understanding in which blood is treated as a tradeable good, in which blood accumulation and depletion in bodily processes relates to its exchange in hospital and medical research practices, and in which transactions can be more or less (un)reasonable. Yet such thinking, rooted in an 'economy of blood', has been overlooked by medical research staff and indeed by historians and anthropologists of Africa whose analyses of blood-stealing have been overly transfixed on rumour and the occult. This paper argues that such cultural framings, which guide local critical commentary on trans-national research orders, require serious attention and need to inform open dialogues between scientists and the public if medical research in resource-poor settings is to continue to be sustainable and politically legitimate.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0277-9536(06)00109-2"

While five serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W135) are responsible for most of the disease, Group A remains unique in its ability to cause large scale epidemics mainly in Africa but also in Asia. The majority of cases in Europe and America are due to Groups B and C. The successful experience with Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has paved the way for the development of polysaccharide conjugate vaccines for the prevention of meningococcal disease. Widespread vaccination with Group C conjugate vaccines now in use in several European countries indicates that these vaccines are immunogenic, induce immunological memory, reduce colonization and provide herd immunity to the general population. A monovalent group A conjugate vaccine being developed at an affordable price, offers hope for the elimination of large epidemics in African countries. Multivalent (A, C, Y, W) conjugate vaccines are being developed, and one has already been licensed.

Although the areas where transmission takes place have reduced, and they are by now confined to the inter tropical areas, the number of people living at risk has grown to about 3 billion, and is expected to go on increasing. Not only does malaria cause around 500 million cases every year, and between 1 and 3 million deaths, but it also carries a huge burden that impairs the economic and social development of large parts of the planet. The failed attempt to eradicate malaria gave way to the control policy that was followed by a huge resurgence of malaria during the late 70s and 80s. Together with the emergence and spread of resistance to chloroquine and the weak health infrastructure in many of the endemic countries, particularly in Africa, the malaria situation worsened worldwide. The last decade of the 20th century was witness to the international community becoming increasingly aware of the unacceptable situation that the burden of malaria represented to large parts of the world. Renewed efforts to describe the problem, design and evaluate new control strategies, design and develop new drugs, better understand the biology of the parasite and the immunity it induces in the human host, develop candidate vaccines, together with new financial support constitute renewed hope that may lead to new trends in global health.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16515506"

We collected cervical samples from 262 women from the general population and 241 tumor samples from women with invasive cervical cancer in Mozambique and tested them for HPV genotyping by the SPF(10)-LiPA(25) PCR system. Among the 195 women without cervical abnormalities by cytology HPV prevalence was 75.9%. In this group of women, the most frequently identified HPV types among HPV-positive women were in descending order of frequency: HPV51 (23.6%), HPV35 (19.6%), HPV18 (14.2%), HPV31 (13.5%) and HPV52 (12.8%). In women with cervical cancer HPV DNA detection was 100%. The type-specific distribution of the most frequent types in descending order of frequency was: HPV16 (47.0%), HPV18 (31.3%), HPV51 (14.8%), HPV52 (14.3%), HPV45 (12.6%), HPV35 (10.4%), HPV33 (4.8%) and HPV31 (2.6%). HPVs 16/18 and HPVs 16/18/31/45 were detected in 71.7% and 80.9% of cervical cancer tissue, respectively. While HPVs 51 and 35 were the two most common types in cytologically normal women in Mozambique, HPVs 16 and 18 remained the two most frequently identified types in cervical cancer. The introduction of an efficacious HPV 16/18 vaccine could potentially prevent the occurrence of 72% of cervical cancer cases and up to 81% of the cases if full cross-protection against HPVs 31 and 45 is assumed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1002/ijc.23292"

Currently, the EPI schedule is similar for HIV-infected children; the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) should considerably prolong their life expectancy.METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To evaluate the persistence of antibodies to the EPI vaccines in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children who previously received these vaccines in routine clinical practice, we conducted a cross-sectional study of children, aged 18 to 36 months, born to HIV-infected mothers and living in Central Africa. We tested blood samples for antibodies to the combined diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP), the measles and the oral polio (OPV) vaccines. We enrolled 51 HIV-infected children of whom 33 were receiving ART, and 78 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected women. A lower proportion of HIV-infected children than uninfected children had antibodies to the tested antigens with the exception of the OPV types 1 and 2. This difference was substantial for the measles vaccine (20% of the HIV-infected children and 56% of the HIV-exposed uninfected children, p&lt;0.0001). We observed a high risk of low antibody levels for all EPI vaccines, except OPV types 1 and 2, in HIV-infected children with severe immunodeficiency (CD4(+) T cells &lt;25%).CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Children were examined at a time when their antibody concentrations to EPI vaccines would have still not undergone significant decay. However, we showed that the antibody concentrations were lowered in HIV-infected children. Moreover, antibody concentration after a single dose of the measles vaccine was substantially lower than expected, particularly low in HIV-infected children with low CD4(+) T cell counts. This study supports the need for a second dose of the measles vaccine and for a booster dose of the DTwP and OPV vaccines to maintain the antibody concentrations in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0001260"

Although the availability of antiretroviral therapy for those infected with HIV has increased worldwide, the infection rate out surpasses those started on such treatment. Without an AIDS vaccine or curative treatment, and given the difficulty in getting persons at risk to adopt healthy sexual behaviors, alternative approaches to decrease the spread of HIV infection are urgently needed. Three recent randomized controlled trials undertaken in Kisumu, Kenya, Raki District, Uganda and Orange Farm, South Africa have confirmed that male circumcision reduces the risk of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men by approximately 51% to 60%. These three studies provide a solid evidence-base for future health policy. The procedure for adolescents and adults is expensive compared to abstinence, condoms or other methods; and the surgery is not without serious risks if performed by traditional healers using unsterilized blades as often happens in rural Africa. However, neonatally, the procedure is relatively inexpensive and the risks diminish considerably. Mandating neonatal male circumcision is an effective therapy that has minimal risks, is cost efficient and will save human lives. To deny individuals access to this effective therapy is to deny them the dignity and respect all persons deserve. Neonatal male circumcision is medically necessary and ethically imperative.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=563742"

For illustration, we apply the method to the programme to vaccinate infants against hepatitis B in the Gambia.METHODS: We synthesized selected data and developed a computer-based model from the societal and payer perspectives to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine infant vaccination against hepatitis B in the Gambia compared with no vaccination. The primary outcome measure was cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which was expressed in 2002 US dollars. We used Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty analysis to examine the affordability of the programme from the payers perspective, and we derived an affordability curve and cost-effectiveness affordability curves for the programme.FINDINGS: In the Gambia, vaccinating infants against hepatitis B is highly cost-effective. Compared with offering no intervention, the vaccination programme would cost US$ 28 per DALY averted from the societal perspective or US$ 47 per DALY averted from the payers perspective. The programme also has the potential to be affordable, starting at a relatively low budget of US$ 160,000 per year. Combining the two dimensions of the outcome measure, the probability that vaccinating infants would be both cost-effective and affordable is 40% at an annual programme budget of US$ 182,000 (the estimated total programme cost from the payers perspective), given a threshold cost-effectiveness value of US$ 47 per DALY averted.CONCLUSION: In the face of uncertainties about both the health and economic consequences of a vaccine programme, as well as the availability and magnitude of resources needed to fund the programme, cost-effectiveness affordability curves can provide information to decision-makers about the probability that a programme will be both cost-effective and affordable: these are distinct but equally relevant considerations in resource-poor settings.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0042-96862007001100009"

Today it remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries, where it is a marker for inadequate drinking water and sanitation infrastructure. Death from cholera can be prevented through simple treatment-oral, or in severe cases, intravenous rehydration. The cholera case-fatality rate therefore reflects access to basic health care. We reviewed World Health Organization (WHO) data on cholera cases and deaths reported between 1960 and 2005. In the 1960s, at the beginning of the seventh and current cholera pandemic, cholera had an exclusively Asian focus. In 1970, the pandemic reached sub-Saharan Africa, where it has remained entrenched. In 1991, the seventh pandemic reached Latin America, resulting in nearly 1 million reported cases from the region within 3 years. In contrast to the persisting situation in Africa, cholera was largely eliminated from Latin America within a decade. In 2005, 31 (78%) of the 40 countries that reported indigenous cases of cholera to WHO were in sub-Saharan Africa. The reported incidence of indigenous cholera in sub-Saharan Africa in 2005 (166 cases/million population) was 95 times higher than the reported incidence in Asia (1.74 cases/million population) and 16,600 times higher than the reported incidence in Latin America (0.01 cases/million population). In that same year, the cholera case fatality rate in sub-Saharan Africa (1.8%) was 3 times higher than that in Asia (0.6%); no cholera deaths were reported in Latin America. The persistence or control of cholera in Africa will be a key indicator of global efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals and of recent commitments by leaders of the G-8 countries to increase development aid to the region.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=77/4/705"

It is estimated that 500 million vitamin A capsules are distributed annually. Policy recommendations have assumed that the supplementation programs offer a proven technology at a relatively low cost of around US$0.10 per capsule.OBJECTIVES: To review data on costs of vitamin A supplementation to analyze the key factors that determine program costs, and to attempt to model these costs as a function of per capita income figures.METHODS: Using data from detailed cost studies in seven countries, this study generated comparable cost categories for analysis, and then used the correlation between national incomes and wage rates to postulate a simple model where costs of vitamin A supplementation are regressed on per capita incomes.RESULTS: Costs vary substantially by country and depend principally on the cost of labor, which is highly correlated with per capita income. Two other factors driving costs are whether the program is implemented in conjunction with other health programs, such as National Immunization Days (which lowers costs), and coverage in rural areas (which increases costs). Labor accounts for 70% of total costs, both for paid staff and for volunteers, while the capsules account for less than 5%. Marketing, training, and administration account for the remaining 25%.CONCLUSIONS: Total costs are lowest (roughly US$0.50 per capsule) in Africa, where wages and incomes are lowest, US$1 in developing countries in Asia, and US$1.50 in Latin America. Overall, this study derives a much higher global estimate of costs of around US$1 per capsule.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17974364"

Hookworm occurs almost exclusively in the setting of rural poverty in the developing countries of the tropics. The rural dependency reflects the precise soil and temperature requirements of the environmental life history stages of the parasite, whereas the relationship between hookworm and poverty is based on multiple factors, including inadequate sanitation, the absence of concrete floors in home dwellings, and lack of access to essential medicines. Also, hookworm not only occurs in the setting of poverty but also promotes poverty because of its health and educational effects in children, its adverse effect on pregnancy outcome, and its effect on worker productivity. Since the middle of the 20th century, poverty reduction and urbanization have successfully reduced the prevalence of hookworm in the world's industrialized nations and some middle-income countries. However, the control of hookworm in low-income countries still relies heavily on the frequent and periodic use of anthelminthic drugs either through deworming programs targeting school-aged children or through integrated control programs that simultaneously target the seven neglected tropical diseases, including hookworm. However, the high rates of hookworm reinfection and the possible emergence of drug resistance will ultimately require the development of new control tools--including the Human Hookworm Vaccine, one of several so-called antipoverty vaccines that could undergo development and testing over the next decade.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=annals.1425.000"

Understanding the reasons for the discrepant results will help to elucidate the action mechanism of this intervention, which is essential for rational policy formulation.METHODS: A comparative analysis of two IPTi trials that used the same study design, follow-up, intervention, procedures and assessment of outcomes, in Tanzania and Mozambique was undertaken. Children were randomised to receive either SP or placebo administered 3 times alongside routine vaccinations delivered through the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI). Characteristics of the two areas and efficacy on clinical malaria after each dose were compared.RESULTS: The most relevant difference was in ITN's use ; 68% in Ifakara and zero in Manhiça. In Ifakara, IPTi was associated with a 53% (95% CI 14.0; 74.1) reduction in the risk of clinical malaria between the second and the third dose; during the same period there was no significant effect in Manhiça.

Incidence of invasive Hib disease was estimated at Kilifi District Hospital and in the surrounding demographic surveillance system in coastal Kenya. National Hib disease incidence was estimated by adjusting incidence observed by passive hospital surveillance using assumptions about access to care. Case fatality rates were also assumed dependent on access to care. A price of US$ 3.65 per dose of pentavalent diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hep B-Hib vaccine was used. Multivariate Monte Carlo simulations were performed in order to assess the impact on the cost-effectiveness ratios of uncertainty in parameter values.FINDINGS: The introduction of Hib vaccine reduced the estimated incidence of Hib meningitis per 100,000 children aged &lt; 5 years from 71 to 8; of Hib non-meningitic invasive disease from 61 to 7; and of non-bacteraemic Hib pneumonia from 296 to 34.

The routine diagnostic methods that are used in many parts of the world are still very similar to those used 100 years ago.

Nevertheless, the duration of treatment needed reduces its effectiveness, as does the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant disease; the latter has recently become widespread.

An immunocontraceptive programme was initiated in a small free-roaming population of elephants at the Greater Makalali Private Game Reserve in Limpopo Province in 2000 to determine whether the porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccine can successfully control population sizes. Further objectives were to determine implementation costs and efficiency through a multi-faceted approach. We have demonstrated that immunocontraception meets the objectives set by managers in the field. Minimal social disruption was observed over the course of treatment, with the mode of delivery (ground or aerial vaccinations) determining the degree of stress within herds and speed of resumption of normal movement patterns. Aerial vaccinations resulted in the least disturbance, with target herds being approachable within a day. In 2005, implementation costs were R880-R1000/elephant/year, inclusive of darts, vaccine, helicopter and veterinary assistance. Irrespective of the source or method of vaccine delivery, a non-pregnant elephant is rendered infertile from 1st vaccine administration. The sooner immunocontraception is implemented, the sooner population growth rates can be controlled. pZP contraception is a realistic alternative management tool, particularly if used as part of a long-term management strategy. Mass-darting from the air eliminates the need for detailed individual histories of each elephant or for employing a person to monitor elephants. Thus, implementation of immunocontraception in larger populations is feasible and practical.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17665762"

We carried out face-to-face and telephone interviews with relevant staff members at regional and subregional levels.FINDINGS: The African Region fell short of the target for 80% of countries to achieve at least 80% immunization coverage by 2005. However, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-3 coverage increased by 15%, from 54% in 2000 to 69% in 2004. As a result, we estimate that the number of nonimmunized children declined from 1.4 million in 2002 to 900,000 in 2004. In 2004, four of seven countries with endemic or re-established wild polio virus had coverage of 50% or less, and some neighbouring countries at high risk of importation did not meet the 80% vaccination target. Reported measles cases dropped from 520,000 in 2000 to 316,000 in 2005, and mortality was reduced by approximately 60% when compared to 1999 baseline levels. A network of measles and yellow fever laboratories had been established in 29 countries by July 2005.CONCLUSION: Rates of immunization coverage are improving dramatically in the WHO African Region. The huge increases in spending on immunization and the related improvements in programme performance are linked predominantly to increases in donor funding.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0042-96862007000600011"

The prevalence and distribution patterns of HIV infection and sociocultural factors found in sub-Saharan African settings are discussed. Challenges include drug financing, drug distribution infrastructure, and government commitment to responding to the HIV pandemic. Priorities include prevention of HIV transmission, management of pediatric patients, availability of affordable medicines, and addressing concerns over the quality of medicines.

Maintaining high coverage over time requires long-term, routine access to new nets (Keep-up). In many settings, only one approach--either campaign or routine delivery--has been available and have been seen as competing methods. Relying only on campaigns achieves high coverage at the cost of lack of later access. Relying solely on routine coverage builds a delivery infrastructure but may lead to slower rates of coverage and inequities. A combined Catch-up/Keep-up approach has been a common feature of vaccination programs for many years. We assessed the 3-year effects of a one-time Catch-up campaign followed by clinic-based social marketing for routine Keep-up on ITN coverage and use.METHODS: In December 2002, ITNs were distributed to all children attending a measles vaccination campaign in a rural district of Ghana. In the 3 years following that campaign, the district began offering ITNs at a subsidized price to pregnant women attending ante-natal clinics. This Keep-up scheme did not become fully operational until 2 years after the campaign. A coverage survey was conducted 38-month post-campaign using a standard two-stage cluster sampling method.RESULTS: Coverage of nets was high due to the combined contributions of both Catch-up and Keep-up. There were 475 households in the survey with at least one child less than 5 years of age. Among these households, coverage was 95.6% with any net, 83.8% with a campaign net, and 73.9% with an ITN. Of all children, 95.7% slept in a household that had a net, 86.1% slept in a household that had a campaign net. Not all available nets were used as only 59.6% of children slept under an ITN. The source of the nets was 77.7% from the campaign and 20% from routine clinics. Compared to households that participated in the campaign, households with children born after the campaign had higher rates of net ownership (75.1% vs. 67.7%, P=0.04). Equity was high as the ratio of coverage in the lowest wealth quintile to that in the highest was 0.95 for ITN ownership and 1.08 for ITN use. These coverage and use rates were similar to those previously reported 5-month post-campaign, suggesting no decrease over 3 years.CONCLUSION: A high level of ITN coverage and use was achieved and sustained by sequential community-based mass campaign Catch-up and clinic-based Keep-up distribution. The campaign nets covered virtually all extant households while clinic-based distribution provided nets for the new sleeping spaces created post-campaign. Because nets can be shared, and most children are born into families that already have a net, the number of new nets needed to sustain high coverage is substantially lower than the number of newborn children. A Catch-up/Keep-up strategy combining mass campaigns for children and clinic-based distribution to pregnant women is an efficient strategy for achieving and sustaining high net coverage. Assuring proper use of nets is a remaining challenge.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=TMI1862"

We considered an adult population defined by gender (male/female), disease stage (HIV-negative, HIV-positive, AIDS, and death), and vaccination status (unvaccinated/vaccinated) in Soweto, South Africa. Input data included initial HIV prevalence of 20% (women) and 12% (men), vaccination coverage of 75%, and exclusive male negotiation of condom use. We explored how changes in vaccine efficacy and postvaccination condom use would affect HIV prevalence and total HIV infections prevented over a 10-year period. In the base-case scenario, a 40% effective HIV vaccine would avert 61,000 infections and reduce future HIV prevalence from 20% to 13%. A 25% increase (or decrease) in condom use among vaccinated individuals would instead avert 75,000 (or only 46,000) infections and reduce the HIV prevalence to 12% (or only 15%). Furthermore, certain combinations of increased risk behavior and vaccines with &lt;43% efficacy could worsen the epidemic. Even modestly effective HIV vaccines can confer enormous benefits in terms of HIV infections averted and decreased HIV prevalence. However, programs to reduce risk behavior may be important components of successful vaccination campaigns.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/QAI.0b013e31812506fd"

Cross-sectoral assessments of interventions such as mass vaccination for brucellosis in Mongolia or vaccination of dogs for rabies in Chad consider human and animal health sectors from a societal economic perspective.

The evaluations used epidemiological and production data, including budgets necessary for the vaccine acquisition, distribution and administration in arriving at the final costs. Using decision tree and cost benefit analysis the economical benefits for Nigeria and countries with similar veterinary infrastructures, biosecurity and farming systems are calculated. The result indicated that a halting in the continued spread of the virus through effective control measure will be 52 times better than taking no action. This should help policy makers in deciding in favour of vaccination combined with other tools as an effective means of controlling avian influenza H5N1. * Control of HPAI H5N1 will best be understood by policy makers in financial terms. * Effective control through vaccination of poultry is much cheaper and reduces the chances of human zoonoses. * Poultry vaccination combined with other control measures will be the most effective means of control in most developing economies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=JVB1044"

Current control measures rely on reactive immunizations with polysaccharide (PS) vaccines that do not induce herd immunity and are of limited effectiveness in those under 2 years of age. Conversely, polysaccharide conjugate vaccines are effective in infants and have consistently shown an important effect on decreasing carriage, two characteristics that facilitate disease control. In 2001 the Meningitis Vaccine Project (MVP) was created as a partnership between PATH and the World Health Organization (WHO) with the goal of eliminating meningococcal epidemics in Africa through the development, licensure, introduction, and widespread use of conjugate meningococcal vaccines. Since group A Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis) is the dominant pathogen causing epidemic meningitis in Africa MVP is developing an affordable (US$ 0.40 per dose) meningococcal A (Men A) conjugate vaccine through an innovative international partnership that saw transfer of a conjugation and fermentation technology to a developing country vaccine manufacturer. A Phase 1 study of the vaccine in India has shown that the product is safe and immunogenic. Phase 2 studies have begun in Africa, and a large demonstration study of the conjugate vaccine is envisioned for 2008-2009. After extensive consultations with African public health officials a vaccine introduction plan has been developed that includes introduction of the Men A conjugate vaccine into standard Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) schedules but also emphasizes mass vaccination of 1-29 years old to induce herd immunity, a strategy that has been shown to be highly effective when the meningococcal C (Men C) conjugate vaccine was introduced in several European countries. The MVP model is a clear example of the usefulness of a &quot;push mechanism&quot; to finance the development of a needed vaccine for the developing world.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(07)00474-4"

Here, we explore the potential impact of an ORV campaign conducted during the 2003-2004 measles epidemic in Niamey, Niger. We measured the impact of this intervention and also the potential impact of alternative strategies. Using a unique geographical, epidemiologic and demographic dataset collected during the epidemic, we developed an individual-based simulation model. We estimate that a median of 7.6% [4.9-8.9] of cases were potentially averted as a result of the outbreak response, which vaccinated approximately 57% (84563 of an estimated 148600) of children in the target age range (6-59 months), 23 weeks after the epidemic started. We found that intervening early (up to 60 days after the start of the epidemic) and expanding the age range to all children aged 6 months to 15 years may lead to a much larger (up to 90%) reduction in the number of cases in a West African urban setting like Niamey. Our results suggest that intervening earlier even with lower target coverage (approx. 60%), but a wider age range, may be more effective than intervening later with high coverage (more than 90%) in similar settings. This has important implications for the implementation of reactive vaccination interventions as they can be highly effective if the response is fast with respect to the spread of the epidemic.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=P72M05N18383730P"

To determine the effects of conjugate Hib vaccine in preventing Hib disease or death in children under five years of age.2. To determine any variation in effect with type of vaccine, number of doses, age at first dose, in children with known HIV infection, or in high and low income countries.3. To determine any serious adverse outcomes.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2006); MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2006); EMBASE (1990 to June 2006) and scanned reference lists and contacting of authors of trial reports. Reports in all languages were considered.SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of conjugate H. influenzae type b vaccines compared with placebo or no treatment in children who were followed until at least two years of age.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected eligible studies and extracted data.MAIN RESULTS: Six studies were included in the review, and four in the meta-analyses. The overall quality of the trials was good. The relative risk for invasive Hib disease was 0.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.54; random-effects model), but there was statistically significant unexplained variation (heterogeneity) in the effects of the four trials in the meta-analysis (P = 0.002). The size of the effects did not appear to differ consistently with different vaccine types, the number of vaccine doses, age at first vaccination or use in high income versus low income countries, but the CIs for the effect estimates were wide. Hib-related mortality data showed a non-significant trend towards benefit (relative risk was 0.29; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.20; random-effects model). The relative risk for all cause mortality in the two trials from which data were available were 1.01 (95% CI 0.38 to 2.67, random-effects model) and 0.97. No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the trials.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hib vaccine is safe and effective.

The cluster survey methodology developed by the World Health Organization, known as the 'Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) methodology', has been used worldwide to assess vaccination coverage; however, the manner in which households are selected has been criticized by survey statisticians as lacking methodological rigor and introducing bias.METHODS: Thirty clusters were selected from an urban (Ambo) and a rural (Yaya-Gulelena D/Libanos) district of Ethiopia; vaccination coverage surveys were conducted using both EPI sampling and systematic random sampling (SystRS) of households. Chi-square tests were used to compare results from the two methodologies; relative feasibility of the sampling methodologies was assessed.RESULTS: Vaccination coverage from a recent measles campaign among children aged 6 months through 14 years was high: 95% in Ambo (both methodologies), 91 and 94% (SystRS and EPI sampling, respectively, P-value = 0.05) in Yaya-Gulelena D/Libanos. Coverage with routine vaccinations among children aged 12-23 months was &lt;20% in both districts; in Ambo, EPI sampling produced consistently higher estimates of routine coverage than SystRS. Differences between the two methods were found in demographic characteristics and recent health histories. Average time required to complete a cluster was 16h for EPI sampling and 17 h for SystRS; total cost was equivalent. Interviewers reported slightly more difficulty conducting SystRS.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the methodological advantages and demonstrated feasibility, SystRS would be preferred to EPI sampling in most situations.

The study included 122 children, 52.5% of whom had an SC phenotype. Coverage for vaccinations included in the WHO expanded vaccination programme was 97.5%. For other specific vaccines, coverage varied from 5.7% for the anti-Haemophilus influenzae vaccine to 65.8% for the 23 pneumococci included in pneumo23. The major reasons for non-vaccination were ignorance and the prohibitive cost of these vaccines for the families who knew about them. These results suggest the need for a national program against sickle cell disease, which should enable treatment centers to include in their preventive activities a specific vaccination program.

Global measles vaccination coverage increased from 71% in 1999 to 76% in 2004 and indigenous transmission was interrupted or kept at very low levels in many countries. However, Africa and Southeast Asia continue to experience endemic transmission and high mortality rates, despite a global mortality reduction of 39% between 1999 and 2003. On the basis of reports from countries with continued indigenous measles virus transmission, future control strategies as well as advantages and potential drawbacks of global measles eradication were discussed. Similarly the burden of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) as well as the cost-effectiveness of rubella vaccination was assessed using different methods in several countries without vaccination programs. As measles and rubella viruses continue to circulate surveillance and control strategies need further optimization. RT-PCR was considered as an alternative method for laboratory diagnosis of CRS. The value of dried blood spots and oral fluid as alternative samples for measles and rubella IgG and IgM detection and genotype determination was evaluated. However further validation of these methods in different settings is required before their routine use can be recommended.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17262908"

This research was carried out in order to learn more about private demand for vaccines in a cholera-endemic area. We asked two types of valuation questions: (1) a discrete-price offer for a vaccine that could be purchased for household members and (2) a payment card designed to assess uncertainty in the respondent's demand for a vaccine for self-protection.

It aimed at reviewing the current situation in the meningitis belt. This region stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia and is characterized by high levels of seasonal endemicity with large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis occurring cyclically, generally caused by N. meningiditis serogroup A. WHO currently recommends a reactive strategy based on rapid detection of epidemics, intervention with antibiotics to treat cases and mass vaccination with a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine to halt the outbreak. Epidemiological patterns of the disease in Africa have been changing with the occurrence of outbreaks outside the meningitis belt and with the emergence of serogroup W135, which first caused an epidemic among Hajj pilgrims in 2000 and then a large-scale meningitis outbreak in Burkina Faso in 2002. Consequently enhanced laboratory surveillance and confirmation of the strain responsible for the outbreak are required. New rapid dipstick tests have been developed through a collaboration between Institut Pasteur and CERMES. They are designed for bedside diagnosis and detect meningococcal antigens present in CSF using immunochromatography. The treatment of meningococcal meningitis during epidemics is based on short-course, long-acting oily chloramphenicol. An alternative is the use of ceftriaxone, which is equally effective and can be used in pregnant women and infants. A low-cost, monovalent serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine for large-scale use in Africa is under development. In spite of the emergence of W135 strains in the meningitis belt, N. meningiditis A continues to be the principal strain isolated during the epidemic seasons and elimination of outbreaks of N. meningiditis serogroup A can still be considered as the primary objective of a preventive vaccination strategy.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17253061"

We used a natural history model to evaluate trends in mortality due to measles.RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2005, according to our model mortality owing to measles was reduced by 60%, from an estimated 873,000 deaths (uncertainty bounds 634,000-1,140,000) in 1999 to 345,000 deaths (247,000-458,000) in 2005. The largest percentage reduction in estimated measles mortality during this period was in the western Pacific region (81%), followed by Africa (75%) and the eastern Mediterranean region (62%).

HIV-infected adults who smoke or have comorbidities are at particular risk. In the absence of highly active antiretroviral therapy, pneumococcal meningitis has emerged in Africa as a major disease burden with a high mortality among HIV-infected children and adults. Conjugate pneumococcal vaccine protects HIV-infected infants from pneumococcal pneumonia.

This will in long-term have an impact on the reduction of morbidity and mortality among adolescent mothers and their newborns.METHODS: This was a qualitative study that employed focus group discussions (FGDs) among adolescent girls (10-19 years) and key informant (KI) interviews with health workers. Age for FGD participants ranged from 16 to 19 years. The FGD participants were recruited while seeking antenatal care for their first pregnancy or immunization service for their first child, not being older than 6 months. Six health facilities were selected. Key informants were purposefully selected on the basis of being in-charge of maternity units. Thirteen FGDs comprising of a total of 92 adolescent girls were conducted. The FGDs were held with homogeneously constituted categories; married pregnant adolescents (5), unmarried pregnant adolescents (3) and married or not married adolescents with children (5). Semi structured interviews were held with six KIs who were in-charge of maternity units of health facilities. Latent content analysis technique was used for data analysis.RESULTS: Two main themes emerged; 'feeling exposed and powerless', and 'seeking safety and empathy'. The categories identified in the first theme were &quot;the dilemma of becoming an adolescent mother&quot; and &quot;lack of decision power&quot;. In the second theme the following categories were identified: &quot;cultural practices and beliefs about birth&quot;, &quot;expectations and experiences&quot;, &quot;transport, a key determinant to health seeking&quot;, and &quot;dealing with constraints&quot;. Adolescents felt exposed and powerless due to the dilemma of early motherhood and lack of decision making power. The adolescent mothers seemed to be in continuous quest for safety and empathy. In so doing they are part of cultural practices and beliefs about birth. They had expectations about the health care services but their experiences of the services were rather negative. Transport was a key determinant for health seeking and adolescents to some extent had learnt how to cope with constraints they face.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Pregnant adolescents seek health care in both modern and traditional health sectors in order to get safety and empathy. However, our findings indicate that they mostly utilize the traditional sector because it is most accessible in terms of distance, cost and cultural context. Adolescent mothers are disempowered in decision making because of their pregnancy state which often puts them in dilemma. We therefore suggest that policy makers need to improve health systems (including the traditional sector) especially maternal health services for adolescent girls. Improved infrastructure and attitudes of health worker as well as training in delivery of adolescent health services is critical.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0140-1971(08)00131-0"

The objective of this survey was to assess vaccination coverage and its determinants in this rural community in NigeriaMETHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in September 2006, which included the use of interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess knowledge of mothers of children aged 12-23 months and vaccination coverage. Survey participants were selected following the World Health Organization's (WHO) immunization coverage cluster survey design. Vaccination coverage was assessed by vaccination card and maternal history. A child was said to be fully immunized if he or she had received all of the following vaccines: a dose of Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG), three doses of oral polio (OPV), three doses of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT), three doses of hepatitis B (HB) and one dose of measles by the time he or she was enrolled in the survey, i.e. between the ages of 12-23 months.

Vaccination coverage against all the seven childhood vaccine preventable diseases was 61.9% although it was significantly higher (p = 0.002) amongst those who had a vaccination card (131/188, 69.7%) than in those assessed by maternal history (79/151, 52.3%). Multiple logistic regression showed that mothers' knowledge of immunization (p = 0.006) and vaccination at a privately funded health facility (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly correlated with the rate of full immunization.CONCLUSION: Eight years after initiation of this privately financed vaccination project (private-public partnership), vaccination coverage in this rural community is at a level that provides high protection (81%) against DPT/OPV. Completeness of vaccination was significantly correlated with knowledge of mothers on immunization and adequate attention should be given to this if high coverage levels are to be sustained.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-8-381"

We report the final analysis.METHODS: A total of 435 adults who were receiving successful ART ((median CD4 cell count prior to ART, 272 cells/mm(3); 88% were receiving a zidovudine-lamivudine-efavirenz regimen) were randomized to receive C-ART or 2/4-ART. The main primary end point was the percentage of patients with &lt;350 CD4 cells/mm(3) at 24 months. The sample size ensured 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority (noninferiority bound, -15%), assuming that 30% of the patients in the C-ART arm would have &lt;350 CD4 cells/mm(3). Other end points were mortality, morbidity, cost of care, genotypic resistance, adherence, and toxicity.RESULTS: The percentage of patients with &lt;350 CD4 cells/mm(3) at 24 months was 5.6% (6 of 107) in the C-ART arm and 14.6% (46 of 315) in the 2/4-ART arm (lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference, -14%). Cost was 18% higher in the C-ART arm, and resistance to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 20% higher in the 2/4-ART arm. Other end points were nonconclusive.CONCLUSIONS: Although 2/4-ART met the predetermined criteria for noninferiority, the percentage of patients with &lt;350 CD4 cells/mm(3) in the C-ART arm was lower than anticipated, which makes the clinical significance of this noninferiority uncertain. In addition, 2/4-ART led to an unacceptable additional risk of selecting for drug-resistant virus. This new argument against episodic ART strategies is also a caveat against any unplanned ART interruptions in Africa, where most patients receive NNRTIs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1086/595298"

A total of 50 in-depth interviews and 6 focus groups were conducted at policy, health service and community levels of enquiry. Respondents expressed overall support for the HPV vaccine, underscored by difficulties associated with the current cervical screening programmes and the burgeoning HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Overall poor community knowledge of cervical cancer and the causal relationship between HPV and cervical cancer suggests the need for continued education around the importance of regular cervical screening. The optimal target populations for HPV vaccination was influenced by the perceived median age of sexual activity in South African girls (9-15 years), with an underlying concern that high levels of sexual abuse had significantly decreased the age of sexual exposure suggesting vaccination should commence as early as 9 years. Vaccination through schools with the involvement of other stakeholders such as sexual and reproductive health and the advanced programme on immunization (EPI) were suggested. Opposition to the HPV vaccine was not anticipated if the vaccine was marketed as preventing cervical cancer rather than a sexually transmitted infection. The findings assist in identifying potential barriers and facilitating factors towards HPV vaccines and will inform the development of policy and programs to support HPV vaccination introduction in South Africa and other African countries.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(08)01424-2"

Domestic dog rabies has been increasing across most of sub-Saharan Africa indicating that dog vaccination programmes to date have been inadequate. We compare the effectiveness of a variety of dog vaccination strategies in terms of their cost and coverage in different community settings in rural Tanzania. Central-point (CP) vaccination was extremely effective in agro-pastoralist communities achieving a high coverage (&gt;80%) at a low cost (&lt;US$2/dog) and was robust under various socio-economic, cultural and spatial factors. In pastoralist communities CP vaccination was costly (&gt;US$5/dog) and inadequate (&lt;20% coverage); combined approaches using CP and either house-to-house vaccination or trained community-based animal health workers were most effective with coverage exceeding 70%, although costs were still high (&gt;US$6 and &gt;US$4/dog, respectively). No single vaccination strategy is likely to be effective in all populations and therefore alternative approaches must be deployed under different settings. CP vaccination is cost-effective and efficient for the majority of dog populations in rural Tanzania and potentially elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas a combination strategy is necessary in remote pastoralist communities. These results suggest that rabies control is logistically feasible across most of the developing world and that the annual costs of effective vaccination campaigns in Tanzania are likely to be affordable.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(08)01307-8"

The widespread resistance of Plasmodium parasites to the cost-effective chloroquine and antifolates has forced the introduction of more costly drug combinations, such as Coartem. In the absence of a vaccine in the foreseeable future, one strategy to address the growing malaria problem is to identify and characterize new and durable antimalarial drug targets, the majority of which are parasite proteins. Biochemical and structure-activity analysis of these proteins is ultimately essential in the characterization of such targets but requires large amounts of functional protein. Even though heterologous protein production has now become a relatively routine endeavour for most proteins of diverse origins, the functional expression of soluble plasmodial proteins is highly problematic and slows the progress of antimalarial drug target discovery. Here the status quo of heterologous production of plasmodial proteins is presented, constraints are highlighted and alternative strategies and hosts for functional expression and annotation of plasmodial proteins are reviewed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-2875-7-197"

The protocol consisted of two-stage screening with transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and automated auditory brainstem response followed by diagnostic evaluation for all infants referred after the second-stage screening. The main outcome measures were referral rates at screening, cost per baby screened, cost per case detected and yield for PCEHL. First-stage referrals were 32.2% for universal and 31.7% for targeted screening in the hospital, compared with 14.3% and 15.2%, respectively for the community-based programme. Second-stage referrals ranged from 3.3% under hospital-based universal screening to 4.9% under community-based targeted screening. The highest yields of 27.4 and 22.5 per 1000 were recorded under community-based targeted and universal screening, respectively. Screening cost per child was lowest (US$7.62) under community-based universal screening and highest (US$73.24) under hospital-based targeted screening. Similarly, cost per child detected with PCEHL was lowest (US$602.49) for community-based universal screening and highest (US$4631.33) for hospital-based targeted screening.

It is estimated that the Programme saved 3 million disability-adjusted life-years between 1996 and 2005, and, with a free supply of ivermectin, this gives an estimated 17% economic rate of return on the cost of treatment delivery. In addition to the substantial direct benefits from the control of onchocerciasis, there are several indirect benefits, including the de-worming of children who receive ivermectin, increased school attendance, general improvements in community and individual health, and increased food production. A key component of the Programme is the co-implementation of onchocerciasis control with other health interventions that can be delivered at the community level. This approach has proved highly effective, leading to higher levels of therapeutic coverage for onchocerciasis control as well as improved delivery of other services, especially vaccination programmes.

The study used participatory epidemiology (PE) methods to estimate the prevalence and mortality of acute and chronic FMD in different age groups of cattle, and the reduction in milk off-take in cows affected by FMD. The benefit-cost of FMD vaccination was 11.5. Losses due to the chronic form of FMD accounted for 28.2% of total FMD losses, indicating that future benefit-cost analyses for FMD control in pastoral and agropastoral areas of Africa need to consider losses caused by chronic disease. Participatory epidemiological methods were also used to assess the importance of milk in the diet of Nuer agropastoralists, and seasonal variations in diet in relation to cattle movements and FMD outbreaks. Marked seasonal variation in diet included a 'hunger gap' period during which households were highly dependent on milk as their main source of food. Outbreaks of FMD occurred immediately before this period of milk dependency, with chronic losses extending through this period and affecting human food security. The paper discusses the need and feasibility of mass vaccination and strategic vaccination for FMD in South Sudan.

We estimate the effectiveness of syndromic treatment for curable STIs in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and the trend in STI prevalences before and after the introduction of syndromic treatment in 1995.METHODS: Data were available from various clinical studies, surveys of public and private health providers, the general population and women attending antenatal, family planning and child immunisation clinics in rural northern KwaZulu-Natal between 1987 and 2004. Overall effectiveness was defined as the estimated proportion of the annual number of symptomatic curable STI episodes cured by syndromic treatment based on separate estimates for six curable STI aetiologies by gender.RESULTS: Median overall effectiveness was 13.1% (95% CI 8.9 to 17.8%) of symptomatic curable STI episodes cured. Effectiveness increased to 25.0% (95% CI 17.3 to 33.8%), 47.6% (95% CI 44.5 to 50.8%) or 14.3% (95% CI 9.9 to 19.4%) if 100% treatment seeking, 100% correct treatment provision or 100% cure were assumed, respectively. Time-trends were difficult to assess formally but there was little evidence of decreasing STI prevalences. Including incurable but treatable herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 ulcers in the effectiveness calculation would halve the proportion of ulcers cured or correctly treated, but this reduction could be entirely countered by including episodic antiviral treatment in the national guidelines.CONCLUSION: Overall effectiveness of syndromic treatment for curable STIs in rural KwaZulu-Natal remains low and there is little evidence of reduced curable STI prevalences.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important bacterial pathogen causing pneumonia in children. The HIV epidemic has increased the burden and severity of childhood pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease fortyfold. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is a highly effective intervention to reduce invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumonia. Studies evaluating a 9-valent PCV in South Africa and The Gambia reported a 72 - 77% reduction in vaccine-serotype-specific invasive disease in vaccinated children. As many of the pneumococcal serotypes associated with antibiotic resistance are included in PCV, vaccination has also been associated with a reduction in antimicrobial-resistant invasive disease. PCV may also reduce childhood mortality, especially in places with limited access to health care, as shown in Gambian study in which PCV reduced childhood mortality by 16%. In addition to the direct effects of PCV, there is a substantial reduction in disease burden through indirect protection of non-vaccinated populations. PCV is immunogenic in HIV-infected children and provides protection against invasive disease or pneumonia in a substantial number of children. Although the efficacy of PCV for prevention of invasive disease or pneumonia is lower in HIV-infected compared to -uninfected children, the overall burden of disease prevented is much greater in HIV-infected children because of the higher burden of pneumococcal disease in these children. Consequently, vaccine-preventable invasive disease is almost 60 times higher in HIV-infected compared to -uninfected children, while the reduction in pneumonia in HIV-infected children is 15 times greater. However, the long-term efficacy of PCV wanes in HIV-infected children who are not taking antiretroviral therapy, and booster doses are probably indicated. Although there is concern about the potential for replacement disease due to non-vaccine serotypes, a substantial and sustained reduction in invasive disease has occurred overall in populations with widespread childhood immunisation. Routine childhood immunisation is now the standard of care in most developed countries. However, PCV is much less accessible to children in developing countries due to cost and availability. Cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that use of PCV is potentially highly cost-effective, at tiered pricing, even in very low-income countries. Widespread availability and vaccination with PCV is urgently needed for all children under 2 years of age in South Africa. In addition, the use of PCV for all HIV-infected children under 9 years should be prioritised.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18683380"

Although the relative importance of many lifestyle factors is becoming better understood in developed countries, more work is needed to understand the importance of these factors in different African settings. In view of the substantial genetic diversity in Africa, it would be prudent not to generalize too widely from one place to the next. We argue that risks for several exposures related to certain cancers differ from the patterns seen in developed countries. In this paper, we review the current knowledge of causes of some of the leading cancers in Africa, namely cancers of the cervix, breast, liver, prostate, stomach, bladder, and oesophagus, Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and tobacco-related cancers. There are no comprehensive cancer-control programmes in Africa and provision of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and palliation is inadequate. Certain cost-effective interventions, such as tobacco control, provision of antiretroviral therapy, and malarial and bilharzial control, can cause substantial decreases in the burden of some of these cancers. Vaccinations against hepatitis B and oncogenic human papilloma viruses can make the biggest difference, but very few countries in Africa can afford these vaccines without substantial subsidization.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S1470-2045(08)70198-0"

Intermittent Preventive Treatment in infants (IPTi) is a promising new tool for malaria control. Although efficacy information is available for many interventions, there is a dearth of data on the resources required for scaling up of health interventions.METHOD: We worked in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) to develop an IPTi strategy that could be implemented and managed by routine health services. We tracked health system and other costs of (1) developing the strategy and (2) maintaining routine implementation of the strategy in five districts in southern Tanzania. Financial costs were extracted and summarized from a costing template and semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants to record time and resources spent on IPTi activities.RESULTS: The estimated financial cost to start-up and run IPTi in the whole of Tanzania in 2005 was US$1,486,284. Start-up costs of US$36,363 were incurred at the national level, mainly on the development of Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) materials, stakeholders' meetings and other consultations. The annual running cost at national level for intervention management and monitoring and drug purchase was estimated at US$459,096. Start-up costs at the district level were US$7,885 per district, mainly expenditure on training. Annual running costs were US$170 per district, mainly for printing of BCC materials. There was no incremental financial expenditure needed to deliver the intervention in health facilities as supplies were delivered alongside routine vaccinations and available health workers performed the activities without working overtime. The economic cost was estimated at 23 US cents per IPTi dose delivered.CONCLUSION: The costs presented here show the order of magnitude of expenditures needed to initiate and to implement IPTi at national scale in settings with high Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) coverage. The IPTi intervention appears to be affordable even within the budget constraints of Ministries of Health of most sub-Saharan African countries.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1472-6963-8-165"

These recombinant proteins were used in a GST-capture ELISA as coating antigens. Human sera were collected from women with cervical cancer. Negative human sera were collected from patients apparently healthy and may be affected by other infectious agents.RESULTS: Most of the sera showed a positive reactivity to at least one of the HPV-16 or HPV-18 proteins (52/71). A percentage of 39.50% of the sera from HPV-16 infected women and 21.12% of the sera from women infected by HPV-18 genotype recognised at least one of the HPV-16 or HPV-18 proteins. Sera showed different reactivity to L1, E6 and E7 antigens, and only a few serum samples reacted to L1, E6 and E7 HPV-16, E6 and E7 HPV-18 (co-infection). Differences of reactivity between cases and controls were significant (P&lt;0.0001).CONCLUSION: This novel ELISA, based on recombinant HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens, is able to detect antibodies in women infected by HPV genotypes. The assay is easy to perform and has low cost, making it suitable for monitoring the natural history of HPV infections as well as for detecting pre-existing HPV antibodies in women who receive vaccination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0369-8114(08)00145-4"

Although more than two dozen countries have had a CHD, little has been published about them. This paper presents an activity-based costing study of Ethiopia's version of CHDs, the Enhanced Outreach Strategy (EOS). The December 2006 round reached more than 10 million beneficiaries at an average cost per beneficiary of US$0.56. When measles is added, the cost of the package doubles. Given the way the distribution day delivery system and the service package are structured, there are economies of scope. Because most of the costs are determined by the number of delivery sites and are independent of the number of beneficiaries, other things equal, increasing the beneficiaries would reduce the average cost per beneficiary. Taking into account only the mortality impact of vitamin A, EOS saved 20,200 lives and averted 230,000 DALYs of children 6-59 months. The average cost per life saved was US$228 and the cost per DALY averted was equivalent to 6% of per capita GDP (US$9), making the EOS cost-effective, according to WHO criteria. While CHDs are generally construed as a temporary strategy for improving coverage of supply-constrained systems, inadequate attention has been paid to demand-side considerations that suggest CHDs have an important role to play in changing care-seeking behaviour, in increasing community organization and participation, and in promoting district autonomy and capacity. Recognition of these effects suggests the need for decisions about where and when to introduce, and when to end, a CHD to take into account more than 'just' health sector considerations: they are more broadly about community development. UNICEF played a key role in initiating the EOS and finances 68% of costs, raising concern about the programme's long-term sustainability.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=czn015"

Recent advances have created opportunities for further improving child survival through prevention of childhood pneumonia by vaccination. Maximizing routine immunization with pertussis and measles vaccines, coupled with provision of a second opportunity for measles immunization, has rapidly reduced childhood deaths in low-income countries especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccines against the two leading bacterial causes of child pneumonia deaths, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), can further improve child survival by preventing about 1,075,000 child deaths per year. Both Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have proven safety and effectiveness for prevention of radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children, including in low-income and industrializing countries. Both are recommended by WHO for inclusion in national programmes, and, at sharply tiered prices, these vaccines generally meet international criteria of cost-effectiveness for low-income countries. Vaccines only target selected pneumonia pathogens and are less than 100% effective, so they must be complemented by curative care and other preventative strategies. As part of a comprehensive child survival package, the particular advantages of vaccines include the ability to reach a high proportion of all children, including those who are difficult to reach with curative health services, and the ability to rapidly scale up coverage with new vaccines. In this review, we discuss advances made in optimizing the use of established vaccines and the potential issues related to newer bacterial conjugate vaccines in reducing childhood pneumonia morbidity and mortality.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0042-96862008000500014"

Male circumcision reduces HIV transmission from female to male by 57 % [95 % Confident Interval (CI): 42-68 %]. Its generalization in sub-Saharan Africa could avert, among men and women, from 1 to 4 millions new HIV infections over the next ten years. Acceptability of this new prevention mean is high in countries which could benefit the most from male circumcision, that means located in southern Africa, a region where in majority men are uncircumcised and where HIV prevalence is high. Male circumcision is a cost-effective prevention strategy. Actual prevention means (condoms, sexual abstinence and fidelity) are not used enough to curb the HIV epidemic. Research is ongoing on other prevention means (vaccine, pre- and post-exposition prophylaxis, microbicides, diaphragm) but their efficiency has not been demonstrated yet. Nevertheless, generalization of circumcision in southern Africa is responsible for contestations in part due to the fact that this prevention mean protects only partially from HIV infection. Moreover, for now, only a few countries integrated circumcision in their HIV prevention program in spite of WHO (World Health Organization) recommendations supporting male circumcision acknowledgement as an additional, important strategy for the prevention of heterosexually acquired HIV infection in men. Significant available funding should allow the situation to evolve quickly. At the same time, research goes on in order to know more about the effects and to facilitate the generalization of this prevention mean which is a great hope for southern Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=00/00/0C/6D/"

Effectiveness was estimated in terms of malaria cases averted, deaths averted and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted. Malaria cases were modelled using regional estimates. Programme and treatment costs were derived through reviews of financial records and interviews with key stakeholders. Uncertain variables were subjected to a univariate sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: Assuming equal attribution of shared costs between the LLITN distribution and the measles vaccination, the net costs per LLITN distributed were 4.41 USD when saved treatment costs were taken into account. Assuming a constant utilization of LLITNs by the target group over three years, 1.2 million cases could be prevented at a net cost per case averted of 3.26 USD. The net costs were 635 USD per death averted and 16.39 USD per DALY averted, respectively.CONCLUSION: The costs per case, death and DALY averted are well within commonly agreed benchmarks set by other malaria prevention studies. Varying transmission levels are shown to have a significant impact on cost-effectiveness ratios. Results also suggest that substantial efficiency gains may be derived from the joint delivery of vaccination campaigns and malaria interventions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-2875-7-73"

The methodological approach to this study is quantitative, using secondary time series data from 1970 to 2003. The study tested three hypotheses using time series multiple regression analysis with autocorrelation adjustment as a statistical model. The results showed that the EPI program had little effect on UFMR in Nigeria. Only the literacy rate and domestic spending on healthcare had statistically significant effects on the UFMR.

Integration has been the frustrated rally call of Primary Health Care for 30 years. This paper discusses the process of integrating child survival strategies and other heath services with immunization in Africa. Immunization is arguably the most successful health programme throughout the continent, making it the logical vehicle for add-on services. Strong health systems are the best way of delivering cost-effective child survival interventions in a most sustainable manner. But the reality in many African countries is that health systems have been weak for a number of reasons. Joining additional cost-effective child survival interventions on to immunization services may provide the needed boost. The unacceptably high childhood mortality in parts of Africa makes it the ideal location to undertake this exercise. The urgency to scale-up child survival interventions that have proven cost-effective is especially important if the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are to be met by 2015. Africa has more to loose than most in failing to scale up to meet these goals, bearing as it does the highest burden of childhood mortality in the world. But so far, prospects do not look good for achieving MDG-4 for the countries with the highest mortality rates. The timeliness of this initiative towards integration could not be better. In the last five years, countries in Africa have received massive injections of financial resources for polio eradication and measles control as well as additional funding for a range of immunization-strengthening activities and the introduction of new and under-utilized vaccines. While the data to support integration are limited, the information to hand suggests the effectiveness of the strategy. Where immunization performance is strong, immunization contacts may be excellent vehicles for additional interventions such as de-worming or Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). But where an immunization service is struggling, adding another child survival intervention on to immunization might be the straw that breaks its back. Health managers have a wide range of options for adding on to immunization services, but the best choice will depend very much on local situations.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(08)00159-X"

The incidence of this infection has been on the rise in recent times. It is estimated that approximately 6 million new HPV infections are acquired each year in the United States alone, and prevalence data suggest that as many as 24 million American adults--that is, 1 in 5--may be infected with HPV. Unfortunately, there is little public awareness and knowledge about the infection and its sequelae. It is well known that more than 90% of cases of anogenital warts are caused by HPV. HPV has been implicated in cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx. The virus is a necessary cause of cervical cancer. HPV DNA is detected in almost 100% of cases of cervical cancer. There have been major strides in recent years in the prevention of this infection and consequently, of diseases related to it. Vaccines are available and licensed in some countries. Two HPV vaccines are available: a quadrivalent (HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine and a bivalent (HPV types 16 and 18) vaccine. Both vaccines show a more than 90% protection against persistent HPV infection for up to 5 years after vaccination. The role of the vaccine in males is still controversial. The vaccination cost, however, is beyond the reach of many individuals in developing countries where 80% of cervical cancer cases of are found.

The cost of almost all these techniques is far beyond the means of health care systems in Africa where they cannot be used. However at least three, i.e., penicillin, vaccines, and hydroxyurea, could be easily accessible in the framework of defined therapeutic strategies. If daily penicillin and pneumococcal vaccine Pneumo 23 are required, it would likely be necessary to select a conjugated vaccine other than Prevenar that does not provide protection against all strains present in Africa. Neonatal screening is still a rare procedure in sub-Saharan countries. Periodic transfusion is steadily improving but exchange transfusion programs aimed in particular at preventing neurological complications are still unfeasible. Indications for hydroxyurea therapy in Africa are more common due to the lack of access to chronic transfusion and must be based on consensus decision. Use of bone marrow transplantation, i.e., the only currently available curative treatment, is still possible only in northern hemisphere countries where it is still restricted to children with severe forms and an HLA-compatible family donor.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18300525"

Tick vaccines constitute a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to tick control. The R. microplus Bm86 protective antigen has been produced by recombinant DNA technology and shown to protect cattle against tick infestations.RESULTS: In this study, the genes for Bm86 (R. microplus), Ba86 (R. annulatus) and Bd86 (R. decoloratus) were cloned and characterized from African or Asian tick strains and the recombinant proteins were secreted and purified from P. pastoris. The secretion of recombinant Bm86 ortholog proteins in P. pastoris allowed for a simple purification process rendering a final product with high recovery (35-42%) and purity (80-85%) and likely to result in a more reproducible conformation closely resembling the native protein. Rabbit immunization experiments with recombinant proteins showed immune cross-reactivity between Bm86 ortholog proteins.CONCLUSION: These experiments support the development and testing of vaccines containing recombinant Bm86, Ba86 and Bd86 secreted in P. pastoris for the control of tick infestations in Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1472-6750-8-14"

Consequently, there is a need to develop an effective, cost-efficient method appropriate to the developing world to identify these infections. In the present study, the heteroduplex assay (HDA) was used to verify dual or single infection status, as shown by traditional sequence analysis, for 15 longitudinally sampled study subjects from Cameroon. Heteroduplex formation, indicative of a dual infection, was identified for all five study subjects shown by sequence analysis to be dually infected. Conversely, heteroduplex formation was not detectable for all 10 HDA reactions of the singly infected study subjects. These results suggest that the HDA is a simple yet powerful and inexpensive tool for the detection of both intersubtype and intrasubtype dual infections, and that the HDA harbors significant potential for reliable, high-throughput screening for dual infection. As these infections and the recombinants they generate facilitate leaps in HIV-1 evolution, and may present major challenges for treatment and vaccine design, this assay will be critical for monitoring the continuing pandemic in regions of the world where HIV-1 viral diversity is broad.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1089/aid.2007.0162"

Although alarming, the emergence of new serogroups in recent epidemics (such as serogroups X and W135) should not mask the fact that serogroup A remains the most common meningococcal isolate from meningitis cases and is therefore the most significant target for control.

The first three of these methods are subject to failure for various epidemiological reasons, and serious disease outbreaks can occur. Prophylaxis is effective, but very expensive, and the logistics are daunting when large herds of animals are involved. The development of a safe, cheap and effective vaccine is the only likely way in which heartwater can be economically controlled, and over the past 15 years three new types of experimental vaccine have been developed: inactivated, attenuated, and recombinant vaccines.

With the imminent eradication of rinderpest from Africa (Somali ecosystem) CBPP has become the disease of prime concern in terms of epizootics that affect cattle on the continent. The control and/or eradication of the disease have suffered from unsustained control actions due to lack of operational funds to support such actions and deterioration in the quality of veterinary services in many countries affected by the disease. Stamping out procedures which were adopted by Botswana to control the disease (1995-1997) cannot be carried out by many countries currently affected by CBPP due to the high financial cost, the widespread nature of disease, animal welfare considerations and the potential loss of a valuable genetic resource base. The current scenario of CBPP disease epidemiology in sub-Saharan Africa requires that proactive measures are taken to safeguard countries in southern Africa which are currently free from CBPP from being contaminated by the disease thus affecting the beef industry and people's livelihoods; and to progressively control the disease in endemic zones of Western and Central Africa. This presentation discusses the epidemiology of CBPP in Africa, diagnosis of the disease, regional strategies that could be deployed to prevent and control the spread of the disease on the continent and research thrusts on CBPP.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19967923"

The purpose of this study was to use a manual, low-cost liquid-based Pap preparation to determine HPV prevalence in HIV-positive and HIV-negative young women in Kampala, Uganda and to correlate cervical cytopathology with HPV-DNA genotype. About 196 post-partum women aged 18-30 years underwent rapid HIV testing and pelvic examination. Liquid-based cervical cytology samples were processed using a low-cost manual technique. A DNA collection device was used to collect specimens for HPV genotyping. HIV and HPV prevalence was 18 and 64%, respectively. Overall, 49% of women were infected with a high-risk HPV genotype. The most common high-risk HPV genotypes were 16 (8.2%), 33 (7.7%), 35 (6.6%), 45 (5.1%), and 58 (5.1%). The prevalence of HPV 18 was 3.6%. HIV-positive women had an HPV prevalence of 86% compared to 59% in HIV-negative women (P = 0.003). The prevalence of HPV 16/18 did not differ by HIV status. HIV-positive women were infected with a significantly greater number of HPV genotypes compared to HIV-negative women. By multivariate analysis, the main risk factor for HPV infection was coinfection with HIV. HIV-positive women were four times more likely to have abnormal cytology than HIV-negative women (43% vs. 11.6%, P &lt; 0.001). These data highlight that HIV infection is a strong risk factor for HPV infection and resultant abnormal cervical cytology. Notably, the manual low-cost liquid-based Pap preparation is practical in this setting and offers an alternate method for local studies of HPV vaccine efficacy.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1002/dc.21249"

Research conducted elsewhere has demonstrated that low-cost vaccines against preventable diseases reduce childhood mortality. Therefore, the extension of vaccination to impoverished populations is widely assumed to diminish equity effects. Recent evidence that childhood mortality is increasing in many countries where vaccination programmes are active challenges this assumption.DATA AND METHODS: This paper marshals data from accurate and complete immunization records and survival histories for 18,368 children younger than five years in a rural northern Ghanaian population that is generally impoverished, but where family wealth and parental educational differentials exist nonetheless. Time-conditional Weibull hazard models are estimated to test the hypothesis that childhood immunization offsets the detrimental effects of poverty and low educational attainment.CONCLUSIONS: Findings show that the adverse effects of poverty disappear and that the effects of educational attainment are reduced in survival models that control for immunization status. This finding lends empirical support to policies that promote immunization as a strategic component of poverty-reduction programmes.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1403494809352532"

We conducted an anthropologic and economic study in Burkina Faso, in the heart of the meningitis belt.

Households spent US $90 per meningitis case, or 34% of the annual gross domestic product per capita, and up to US $154 more when meningitis sequelae occurred. Much of this cost was attributable to direct medical expenses, which in theory are paid by the government.

Our analysis incorporated new findings on vaccine herd protective effects.METHODS: Using data from Matlab, Bangladesh, Kolkata, India, North Jakarta, Indonesia, and Beira, Mozambique, we calculated the net public cost per disability-adjusted life year avoided for three immunization strategies: 1) school-based vaccination of children 5 to 14 years of age; 2) school-based vaccination of school children plus use of the schools to vaccinate children aged 1 to 4 years; and 3) community-based vaccination of persons aged 1 year and older.RESULTS: We determined cost-effectiveness when vaccine herd protection was or was not considered, and compared this with commonly accepted cutoffs of gross domestic product (GDP) per person to classify interventions as cost-effective or very-cost effective. Without including herd protective effects, deployment of this vaccine would be cost-effective only in school-based programs in Kolkata and Beira. In contrast, after considering vaccine herd protection, all three programs were judged very cost-effective in Kolkata and Beira. Because these cost-effectiveness calculations include herd protection, the results are dependent on assumed vaccination coverage rates.CONCLUSIONS: Ignoring the indirect effects of cholera vaccination has led to underestimation of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination programs with oral cholera vaccines.

To determine the effects of conjugate Hib vaccine in preventing Hib disease or death in children under five years of age. 2. To determine any variation in effect with type of vaccine, number of doses, age at first dose, in children with known HIV infection, or in high and low income countries. 3. To determine any serious adverse outcomes.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2006, issue 4) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2006); EMBASE (1990 to June 2006) and scanned reference lists and contacting of authors of trial reports.SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of conjugate H. influenzae type b vaccines compared with placebo or no treatment in children who were followed until at least two years of age.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected eligible studies and extracted data.MAIN RESULTS: Six studies were included in the review, and four in the meta-analyses. The overall quality of the trials was good. The relative risk for invasive Hib disease was 0.20 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.54; random-effects model), but there was statistically significant unexplained variation (heterogeneity) in the effects of the four trials in the meta-analysis (P = 0.002). The size of the effects did not appear to differ consistently with different vaccine types, the number of vaccine doses, age at first vaccination or use in high income versus low income countries, but the CIs for the effect estimates were wide. Hib-related mortality data showed a non-significant trend towards benefit (relative risk was 0.29; 95% CI 0.07 to 1.20; random-effects model). The relative risk for all cause mortality in the two trials from which data were available were 1.01 (95% CI 0.38 to 2.67, random-effects model) and 0.97. No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the trials.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Hib vaccine is safe and effective.

At $3 per series, a program would cost $2.1 million in medical costs annually; the break-even price is $2.07 per series.CONCLUSIONS: A rotavirus vaccination program would reduce the substantial burden of rotavirus disease and the economic burden in Kenya.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1086/605058"

In November 2005, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts first reviewed the clinical efficacy data from 2 new live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines, which demonstrated excellent protective efficacy against severe rotavirus disease in regions where they were evaluated. Despite these successes, the WHO has urged the clinical evaluation of these vaccines in populations of Africa and Asia, where most of the deaths due to rotavirus occur, and has emphasized the need for ongoing postlicensure safety monitoring in countries introducing vaccines. Clinical studies in Africa and Asia will soon provide data on the efficacy of both new vaccines in these populations. A WHO international consultative meeting convened to evaluate how to use these imminent data for the future use of rotavirus vaccines in developing countries. In brief, it was agreed that (1) even vaccines with lesser efficacy in developing countries, compared with industrialized countries, would still lead to substantial public health benefits and would be cost-effective in saving lives in Africa and Asia; (2) criteria, such as the WHO mortality strata and local epidemiology of rotavirus infection, would be appropriate measures for extrapolating the clinical data to other regions and countries; and (3) research toward understanding the programmatic limitations of rotavirus vaccine use may help develop strategies to improve vaccine uptake and overall impact.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1086/605042"

Clinical trials in low-income countries in Africa and Asia are ongoing. Experience gained through studies of natural rotavirus infection and the clinical trials for the current and previous rotavirus vaccines indicate that, as countries begin to introduce these newly approved vaccines into routine childhood immunization programs, monitoring their performance in real world settings should be a high priority. Key epidemiological considerations in the postlicensure period include (1) how the vaccine will perform against severe rotavirus disease under routine public health use; (2) how routine vaccination will impact the epidemiology of disease with regard to the burden of severe disease and death, age distribution of cases, seasonality, and serotype distribution; (3) whether vaccination will have a sufficient impact on transmission to reduce disease burden in unvaccinated age groups; and (4) whether vaccine will confer protection through the first 3 years of life, when most severe disease and mortality associated with rotavirus occur. Monitoring of impact with focus on these public health considerations will allow parents, health care providers, and decision makers to appreciate the health benefits of vaccination in reducing the burden of severe rotavirus disease. It will also allow assessment of the effectiveness of rotavirus vaccines in programmatic use and the need for modifying vaccination schedules or vaccine formulations to enhance the performance of immunization. In this article, we review data for the protective efficacy of the 2 new rotavirus vaccines, with emphasis on issues particularly important for consideration as these vaccines are introduced in routine infant immunization programs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1086/605059"

The prevalence of HPV16/18, the two vaccine preventable-types, among women with ICC, does not appear to differ by HIV status on a small case series. However, there are limited data on the role of HIV in the natural history of HPV infection in SSA. Cervical screening coverage ranges from 2.0% to 20.2% in urban areas and 0.4% to 14.0% in rural areas.

Insect control is an essential part of reducing transmission. To date, two operational scale interventions, indoor residual spraying and deployment of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), are effective at reducing transmission. Our ability to monitor and evaluate these interventions needs to be improved so that scarce resources can be sensibly deployed, and new interventions that reduce transmission in a cost-effective and efficient manner need to be developed. New interventions could include using transgenic mosquitoes, larviciding in urban areas, or utilizing cost-effective consumer products. Alongside this innovative development agenda, the potential negative impact of insecticide resistance, particularly on LLINs, for which only pyrethroids are available, needs to be monitored.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1146/annurev-ento-112408-085423"

Potential cost-savings for the public health sector of interventions aimed at animal-host reservoirs should be assessed. Available deterministic models of rabies transmission between dogs were extended to include dog-to-human rabies transmission. Model parameters were fitted to routine weekly rabid-dog and exposed-human cases reported in N'Djaména, the capital of Chad. The estimated transmission rates between dogs (beta(d)) were 0.0807 km2/(dogs x week) and between dogs and humans (beta(dh)) 0.0002 km2/(dogs x week). The effective reproductive ratio (R(e)) at the onset of our observations was estimated at 1.01, indicating low-level endemic stability of rabies transmission. Human rabies incidence depended critically on dog-related transmission parameters. We simulated the effects of mass dog vaccination and the culling of a percentage of the dog population on human rabies incidence. A single parenteral dog rabies-mass vaccination campaign achieving a coverage of least 70% appears to be sufficient to interrupt transmission of rabies to humans for at least 6 years. The cost-effectiveness of mass dog vaccination was compared to postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), which is the current practice in Chad. PEP does not reduce future human exposure. Its cost-effectiveness is estimated at US $46 per disability adjusted life-years averted. Cost-effectiveness for PEP, together with a dog-vaccination campaign, breaks even with cost-effectiveness of PEP alone after almost 5 years. Beyond a time-frame of 7 years, it appears to be more cost-effective to combine parenteral dog-vaccination campaigns with human PEP compared to human PEP alone.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=0904740106"

The impact of cryptosporidiosis is also compounded by the spread of HIV/AIDS and a lack of cost-effective anti-cryptosporidial chemotherapeutics or vaccines. Mitigation of the impact of cryptosporidiosis in humans needs to focus on prevention and control strategies, built on a sound understanding of the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium species. Refined epidemiological studies rely on the use of molecular tools employing informative genetic markers. Currently, the 60-kDa glycoprotein gene (gp60) is the most suitable and widely used genetic marker for Cryptosporidium species infecting humans. Here, we undertake an analysis of all publicly-available gp60 sequence data and associated literature for C. hominis and C. parvum, and yield useful insights into the richness, diversity and distribution of genetic variants, and link these variants to human cryptosporidiosis. This global analysis reveals that, despite high genetic richness in Cryptosporidium isolates from humans, there is a surprisingly low diversity. It also highlights limited knowledge about the genetics of cryptosporidiosis in developing nations and in many animals that might act as infection sources. Clearly, there is a major need for more comprehensive studies of Cryptosporidium infecting humans and other animals in Africa and Asia. As molecular technologies improve and become affordable, future studies should utilize &quot;next generation&quot; sequencing and bioinformatic platforms to conduct comparative 'genome sequence surveys' to test the validity of current genetic classifications based on gp60 data. Complemented by in vitro and in vivo investigations, these biotechnological advances will also assist significantly in the search for new intervention strategies against human cryptosporidiosis.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0734-9750(09)00149-9"

This anomaly in health research investment in SSA is mainly attributed to rampant poverty, weak educational institutions, deficient health research capacity, feeble communications systems and isolation. Translating research results into action, manufacturing and access are also weak. Furthermore, many diseases of poverty are neglected diseases, they receive scanty research attention; there are no new drugs or vaccines for their treatment or prevention. The situation in SSA is made worse by the surge in noncommunicable diseases and injuries. The paper reviews actions taken over the last two decades to resolve the 10/90 gap through: (i) policies prioritizing funding for health research, (ii) developing capacities of credible public and private SSA health research institutions, (iii) activities of international NGOs undertaking research aimed at resolving the gap, and (iv) the setting up of research based mechanisms to ensure access to new effective products for the treatment and prevention of poverty-related diseases. The paper highlights examples for each of the above, and discusses the overall situation.

The methods used in Vietnam in implementing blanket vaccination against H5N1 HPAI viruses demonstrate the steps that should be considered when introducing vaccination. So far, it has not been possible to determine the precise effect of vaccination in endemically infected countries because it has been used in combination with other measures. Well managed vaccination campaigns will reduce the incidence of infection in poultry and therefore reduce the risk to humans from these viruses.

It is now estimated that HIV has been in humans since at least the early 1900s. However, despite the potential for different divergent viruses to spread, surprisingly few viruses successfully expanded to cause the global epidemic. In approximately 80% of cases, productive infection is the result of infection with only a single virus or single virus-infected cell. After transmission, HIV evolves at a rapid rate driven by the immune pressure until the virus reaches a delicate survival balance: on one hand avoiding elimination through the development of cytotoxic T-cell immune escape mutations, and on the other sacrificing replication fitness as these mutations may come with a severe fitness cost to the virus. People infected with these 'attenuated' cytotoxic T-cell escape viruses can have a survival advantage. Cytotoxic T-cell responses are molding HIV diversity at a population level resulting in a loss of some of the common immune epitopes.SUMMARY: Insights into the origin of HIV and its evolution between populations and within individuals is essential to understanding HIV pathogenesis and imperative for the design of effective biomedical interventions such as vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/COH.0b013e32832c0672"

Consequently, the reported malaria burden is being reduced in a number of countries throughout the world, including in some countries in tropical Africa where the burden of malaria is greatest. These achievements have raised new hopes of eradicating malaria. This paper summarizes the outcomes of a World Health Organization's expert meeting on the feasibility of such a goal. Given the hindsight and experience of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme of the 1950s and 1960s, and current knowledge of the effectiveness of antimalarial tools and interventions, it would be feasible to effectively control malaria in all parts of the world and greatly reduce the enormous morbidity and mortality of malaria. It would also be entirely feasible to eliminate malaria from countries and regions where the intensity of transmission is low to moderate, and where health systems are strong. Elimination of malaria requires a re-orientation of control activity, moving away from a population-based coverage of interventions, to one based on a programme of effective surveillance and response. Sustained efforts will be required to prevent the resurgence of malaria from where it is eliminated. Eliminating malaria from countries where the intensity of transmission is high and stable such as in tropical Africa will require more potent tools and stronger health systems than are available today. When such countries have effectively reduced the burden of malaria, the achievements will need to be consolidated before a programme re-orientation towards malaria elimination is contemplated. Malaria control and elimination are under the constant threat of the parasite and vector mosquito developing resistance to medicines and insecticides, which are the cornerstones of current antimalarial interventions. The prospects of malaria eradication, therefore, rest heavily on the outcomes of research and development for new and improved tools. Malaria control and elimination are complementary objectives in the global fight against malaria.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=TMI2287"

Cross-sectional baseline and follow-up household surveys were conducted in the two intervention districts and one control district.RESULTS: Insecticide-treated nets utilization among children aged 12-23 months roughly doubled in the two intervention districts and did not change in the control district. Timely vaccination coverage increased in all three districts. The percentage of children aged 12-23 months who were both fully vaccinated by 12 months and slept under an ITN the night prior to the interview increased from 10-14% at baseline to 40-44% at follow-up in the intervention districts (P &lt; 0.001), but did not change significantly in the control district.CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate the provision of free ITNs at completion of a child's primary vaccination series, demonstrating that such a linkage is both feasible and can result in improved coverage with the combined services. Additional studies are needed to determine whether such a model is effective in other countries, and whether integration of other health services with immunization delivery could also be synergistic.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=TMI2295"

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) have demonstrated efficacy against childhood invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and pneumonia in the United States and Africa. No information is available from Asia on the impact of PCV on childhood pneumonia.METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in Bohol, the Philippines (ISRCTN 62323832). Children 6 weeks to &lt;6 months of age were randomly allocated to receive 3 doses of either an 11-valent PCV (11PCV, sanofi pasteur, Lyon, France) or a saline placebo, with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses to determine vaccine efficacy (VE) against the primary outcome of a child experiencing first episode of community-acquired radiologically defined pneumonia in the first 2 years of life. Secondary end points were clinical pneumonia, IPD, safety, and immunogenicity.RESULTS: Twelve thousand one hundred ninety-one children were enrolled. By per protocol (PP) analysis, 93 of 6013 fully vaccinated 11PCV recipient children had a first episode of radiologic pneumonia compared with 120 of 6018 placebo recipients. VE against radiologically defined pneumonia for the PP cohort of children 3 to 23 months old was 22.9% (95% CI: -1.1, 41.2; P = 0.06), for the prespecified subgroups of children 3 to 11 months of age, 34.0% (95% CI: 4.8, 54.3; P = 0.02), and of those 12 to 23 months old, 2.7% (95% CI: -43.5, 34.0; P = 0.88). By intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 119 of 6097 11PCV recipient children had an episode of radiologic pneumonia compared with 141 of 6094 placebo recipients. VE against radiologic pneumonia for the ITT cohort of children &lt;2 years old was 16.0% (95% CI -7.3, 34.2; P = 0.16), for a subgroup of children &lt;12 months of age, 19.8% (95% CI: -8.8, 40.8; P = 0.15). VE against clinical pneumonia by PP was not significant (VE 0.1%; 95% CI -9.4, 8.7; P = 0.99). IPD was rare: only 3 cases of IPD due to vaccine serotypes were observed during the study. 11PCV was immunogenic and well tolerated. Among 11PCV recipients, a small excess of serious adverse respiratory events was observed in the first 28 days after the first and second dose of vaccine, and of nonrespiratory events after the first dose. An excess of pneumonia episodes in 11PCV recipients in the month following the second dose of vaccination was the principal reason for lower VE by ITT analysis than by PP analysis.CONCLUSIONS: In PP analysis, a 22.9% reduction of community-acquired radiologically confirmed pneumonia in children younger than 2 years of age in the 11-valent tetanus-diphtheria toxoid-conjugated PCV vaccinated group was observed; a reduction similar as observed in other PCV trials. We could not demonstrate any VE against clinical pneumonia. Our finding confirms for the first time that in a low-income, low-mortality developing country in Asia, at least one-fifth of radiologically confirmed pneumonia is caused by pneumococcus, and thus preventable by PCV. Whether PCV should be included in national program in such settings, however, depends on careful country specific disease burden measurement and cost-effectiveness calculation.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/INF.0b013e31819637af"

A total of 723 cattle comprised of 497 animals from the pastoral system and 226 animals from the zerograzing system were tested for antibodies against natural B. abortus infection using the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA). Herd-level seroprevalence was 100% in the pastoral system and 5.5% (95% CI: 1.8, 9.2) in the zerograzing system.

This study explored the ethical challenges identified by various stakeholders, through an open-ended, in-depth approach. While the few previous studies have been largely quantitative, respondents in this study had the opportunity to spontaneously identify the issues that they perceived to be of priority concern in the South African context. Stakeholders spontaneously identified the following as ethical priorities: informed consent, social harms, collaborative relationships between research stakeholders, the participation of children and adolescents, access to treatment for participants who become infected with HIV, physical harms, fair participant and community selection, confidentiality, benefits, and payment. While there is some speculation that research in developing countries poses special ethical challenges, overall no issues were identified that have not been anticipated in international guidance, literature and popular frameworks. However, the South African context affords a distinctive gloss to these expected issues; for example, respondents were concerned that the predominant selection of black participants may perpetuate racist practices of apartheid. Stakeholders should be aware of contextual factors impacting on the implementation of ethical principles. We make a series of recommendations for South African trials, including amendments to the ethical-legal framework and research policies, and, for further research.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=DEWB254"

This service, which requires a stringent cold chain, used to be free of charge. When a minimal user fee was introduced, attendance dropped drastically. Consequently, this complex immunisation programme was transferred to veterinary paraprofessionals working on their own account, with the aim of boosting a more sustainable distribution of vaccine. Paraprofessionals were provided with a motorbike and the required specific equipment, but fuel and drugs were at their expenses. The paraprofessionals recovered their costs, with a profit margin, by charging the cattle owners for immunisation. The reasons for the successful transfer of immunisation to paraprofessionals (despite the maintenance of a fee) are attributed mainly to the absence of information asymmetry between the paraprofessional and the livestock owner, the appreciable level of effort of the paraprofessionals and the verifiable outcome of the service provided.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19284042"

This study examines the impact of this strategy on the epidemiology of measles in Uganda, and the lessons learnt. METHODS Number of measles cases and routine measles vaccination coverage reported by each district were obtained from the National Health Management Information System reports of 1997 to 2007. The immunization coverage by district in a given year was calculated by dividing the number of children immunized by the projected population in the same age category. Annual measles incidence for each year was derived by dividing the number of cases in a year by the mid-year projected population. Commercial measles IgM enzyme-linked immunoassay kits were used to confirm measles cases. RESULTS Routine measles immunization coverage increased from 64% in 1997 to 90% in 2004, then stabilized around 87%. The 2003 national measles catch-up and 2006 follow-up campaigns reached 100% of children targeted with a measles supplemental dose. Over 80% coverage was also achieved with other child survival interventions. Case-based measles surveillance was rolled out nationwide to provide continuous epidemiological monitoring of measles occurrence. Following a 93% decline in measles incidence and no measles deaths, epidemic resurgence of measles occurred 3 years after a measles campaign targeting a wide age group, but no indigenous measles virus (D(10)) was isolated. Recurrence was delayed in regions where children were offered an early second opportunity for measles vaccination. CONCLUSION The integrated routine and campaign approach to providing a second opportunity for measles vaccination is effective in interrupting indigenous measles transmission and can be used to deliver other child survival interventions. Measles control can be sustained and the inter-epidemic interval lengthened by offering an early second opportunity for measles vaccination through other health delivery strategies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=czp008"

Based on the efficacy results of the intervention and on malaria incidence in the target population, an estimate was made of the number of clinical malaria episodes prevented. This number and an assumed case-fatality rate of 1.57% were used, in turn, to estimate the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and the number of deaths averted. The cost of the intervention, including start-up and recurrent costs, was then assessed on the basis of these figures.FINDINGS: The cost per clinical episode of malaria averted was US$ 1.57 (range: US$ 0.8-4.0) in Ifakara and US$ 4.73 (range: US$ 1.7-30.3) in Manhiça; the cost per DALY averted was US$ 3.7 (range: US$ 1.6-12.2) in Ifakara and US$ 11.2 (range: US$ 3.6-92.0) in Manhiça; and the cost per death averted was US$ 100.2 (range: US$ 43.0-330.9) in Ifakara and US$ 301.1 (range: US$ 95.6-2498.4) in Manhiça.CONCLUSION: From the health system and societal perspectives, IPTi with SP is expected to produce health improvements in a cost-effective way.

For each of the different types of vaccine used during drought years there was no significant difference in livestock mortality, for any species, in vaccinated compared with non-vaccinated herds. The limited impact of vaccination on livestock mortality was attributed to weaknesses in the design and implementation of vaccination programmes, including use of inappropriate vaccines, low vaccination coverage, problems with vaccine dosing, incorrect timing of vaccination and problems with vaccine storage. If these weaknesses could be overcome vaccination could be a useful means to protect livestock assets, with considerable benefit-cost ratios.

The infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Nigeria.OBJECTIVE: This review set out to present in one concise volume a review of the major findings from published articles on the burden and impact of typhoid fever in Nigeria to aid easy reference for researchers. It highlights the disease burden, the different diagnostic methods and their sensitivities, complications, treatment methods as well as the various preventive measures including the use of typhoid vaccine in the control of the disease.METHODS: Several published articles covering a period of 40 years were accessed different journals and reviewed, and their major findings presented in this review.RESULTS: The disease burden from typhoid fever in Nigeria is still high with associated serious complications, which in most cases have been managed effectively with the use of potent antibiotics and surgical intervention. However, the typhoid problem has been compounded by the emergence and circulation of multi-drug resistant strains of the organism being sensitive only to the newer generation antibiotics.CONCLUSION: Typhoid fever remains a major public health problem in Nigeria. The infection however can be prevented by good sanitation, improving good water supply, the provision of proper sewage disposal system, as well as the effective use of the available typhoid vaccines.

The results of our analyses provided evidence that in addition to public expenditure on health, the availability of physicians, female literacy, and child immunization are also important determinants of health status in Lesotho. Contrary to findings from earlier studies, our analyses also found income per capita to be an insignificant determinant of health status.

This vaccine was substituted with DTwP in a 10-dose vial. We aimed to estimate the incremental system costs of pentavalent vaccine delivery.METHODS: Data on cold storage expansion and increased vaccine transport frequency were collected in four regions of Ethiopia over a 2-week period, as part of a Post-Introduction Evaluation of the new vaccine. Interviews were conducted with individuals at all levels of the health system. Information on the costs of training and communication to facilitate the introduction was collected from the Ministry of Health, UNICEF and WHO in Addis Ababa.RESULTS: The switch from a 10-dose DTwP to a single dose pentavalent vaccine increased refrigeration storage volume per fully vaccinated child by 106% at national and regional levels and by 71% at the three lower levels of vaccine distribution. Cold storage equipment were purchased at all levels and the frequency of vaccine collection more than doubled in many places. Incremental capital costs of cold storage equipment, training and communication amounted to US$ 4.8 million, or US$ 1.53 per child in the 2007 birth cohort. After annualizing capital costs and adding recurrent costs, system costs came to US$ 0.80 per child in the 2007 birth cohort. With a vaccination coverage rate of 78% this is equivalent to US$ 1.13 per fully vaccinated child. The most important system cost item is cold storage, amounting to US$ 0.62 per child in the birth cohort and US$ 0.03 per additional cm(3) of cold storage.CONCLUSION: In Ethiopia introduction of pentavalent vaccine necessitated considerable investments in additional cold storage equipment as well as an increase in vaccine transport frequency. A GAVI Alliance introduction grant of US$ 0.30 per child in the birth cohort would cover approximately 20% of the capital investments undertaken to facilitate introduction.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(08)01762-3"

To address these threats, countries within the World Health Organization (WHO) African region adopted a regional strategy called Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). This strategy calls for streamlining resources, tools, and approaches to better detect and respond to the region's priority communicable disease. The purpose of this study was to analyze the incremental costs of establishing and subsequently operating activities for detection and response to the priority diseases under the IDSR.METHODS: We collected cost data for IDSR activities at central, regional, district, and primary health care center levels from Burkina Faso, Eritrea, and Mali, countries where IDSR is being fully implemented. These cost data included personnel, transportation items, office consumable goods, media campaigns, laboratory and response materials and supplies, and annual depreciation of buildings, equipment, and vehicles.RESULTS: Over the period studied (2002-2005), the average cost to implement the IDSR program in Eritrea was $0.16 per capita, $0.04 in Burkina Faso and $0.02 in Mali. In each country, the mean annual cost of IDSR was dependent on the health structure level, ranging from $35,899 to $69,920 at the region level, $10,790 to $13,941 at the district level, and $1,181 to $1,240 at the primary health care center level. The proportions spent on each IDSR activity varied due to demand for special items (e.g., equipment, supplies, drugs and vaccines), service availability, distance, and the epidemiological profile of the country.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the IDSR strategy can be considered a low cost public health system although the benefits have yet to be quantified. These data can also be used in future studies of the cost-effectiveness of IDSR.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1478-7547-7-1"

Lessons on the procedure include the importance of the position of the evaluability assessor, the value of replicating some steps of the assessment and the relationships between EA and process evaluation. The evaluability study concludes that the intervention had some evaluable components. To satisfy the stakeholders' needs, the initially planned community randomized controlled trial can be maintained and complemented with a process evaluation. There is a need to provide sufficient information on the cost of the intervention.

We carried out a one-year cross sectional epidemiological study (January-December, 2008) to determine the prevalence of occupationally-acquired pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among Health- Care Workers (HCWs) in Ibadan, Nigeria. This information is important for planning preventive strategies. All consenting HCWs at two TB centres in Ibadan--the University College Hospital (UCH) and Jericho Chest Hospital were enrolled into the study. A well structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects including their medical and social data. Three sputum samples collected from each subject were processed for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and culture on selective medium. Isolates were confirmed as M. tuberculosis by standard biochemical tests. Of the 271 subjects recruited, nine (3.3%) had their sputum positive for AFB while six (2.2%) were positive for culture. Subjects aged 20 years and above, female gender and unskilled professionals had higher risk for occupationally-acquired PTB than those who were 20 years and below, male gender and skilled professionals (Odd Ratio OR = 1.9, 95% Confidence Interval, 95% CI = 0.23-16.3, Fisher's exact P = 0.37; OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.28-4.0, p = 0.01; OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02-1.08, p = 3.43) respectively.

We estimated the incremental costs of transitioning from needles and syringes to delivering childhood vaccines with DSJIs in Brazil, India, and South Africa.METHODS: Two scenarios were assessed: (1) DSJI delivery of all vaccines at current dose and depth; (2) a change to intradermal (ID) delivery with DSJIs for hepatitis B and yellow fever vaccines, while the other vaccines are delivered by DSJIs at current dose and depth. The main advantage of ID delivery is that only a small fraction of the standard dose may be needed to obtain an immune response similar to that of subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. Cost categories included were vaccines, injection equipment, waste management, and vaccine transport. Some delivery cost items, such as training and personnel were excluded as were treatment cost savings caused by a reduction in diseases transmitted due to unsafe injections.RESULTS: In the standard dose and depth scenario, the incremental costs of introducing DSJIs per fully vaccinated child amount to US$ 0.57 in Brazil, US$ 0.65 in India and US$ 1.24 in South Africa. In the ID scenario, there are cost savings of US$ 0.11 per child in Brazil, and added costs of US$ 0.45 and US$ 0.76 per child in India and South Africa, respectively. The most important incremental cost item is jet injector disposable syringes.CONCLUSION: The incremental costs should be evaluated against other vaccine delivery technologies that can deliver the same benefits to patients, health care workers, and the community. DSJIs deserve consideration by global and national decision-makers as a means to expand access to ID delivery and to enhance safety at marginal additional cost.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(10)01672-5"

In the absence of a cure, behavioral change has been advocated as an intervention strategy for reversing the epidemic. Empirical studies have found heavy alcohol consumption to be a fueling factor for HIV/AIDS infection and progression. Previously [20], we formulated and analyzed a one-sex deterministic model to capture the dynamics of this deadly interaction. But, since alcohol drinking habits, consequent risky sexual practices, alcohol-induced immune suppression, etc., can be different for men and women, the primary objective of our present paper is to construct a two-sex model aimed at shedding light on how both sexes, with varying heavy alcohol consumption trends, contribute differently to the HIV/AIDS spread. Based on numerical simulations, supported by the UNAIDS epidemiological software SPECTRUM and using the available data, our study identifies heavy drinking among men and women to be a major driving force for HIV/AIDS in Botswana and sub-Sahara Africa and quantifies its hazardous outcomes in terms of increased number of active TB cases and economic burden caused by increased need for AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART). Our simulations point to the heavy-drinking habits of men as a major reason for the continuing disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on women in sub-Sahara Africa. Our analysis has revealed the possibility of the phenomenon of backward bifurcation. In contrast to the result in some HIV vaccination models [52], backward bifurcation in our model is not removed by replacing the corresponding standard incidence function with a mass action incidence, but is removed by merging the two susceptible classes of the same sex into one, i.e., by ignoring acquisition of, and ongoing recovery from, heavy-drinking habits among the susceptible population.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21077713"

The first vaccines introduced have been the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and the hepatitis B (Hep B) vaccines. The introduction of these vaccines during the first phase of GAVI's operations demonstrated considerable variability. We set out to study the factors affecting the introduction of these vaccines. The African Region (AFRO), where new vaccines were introduced to a substantial number of countries during the first phase of GAVI's funding, was selected for this study.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: GAVI-eligible AFRO countries with a population of 0.5 million or more were included in the study. Countries were analyzed and compared for new vaccine introduction, healthcare indicators, financial indicators related to healthcare and country-level Governance Indicators, using One Way ANOVA, correlation analysis and Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). Introduction of new vaccines into AFRO nations was associated primarily with high country-level Governance Indicator scores. The use of individual Governance Indicator scores, as well as a combined Governance Indicator score we developed, demonstrated similar results.SIGNIFICANCE: Our study results indicate that good country-level governance is an imperative pre-requisite for the successful early introduction of new vaccines into poor African nations. Enhanced support measures may be required to effectively introduce new vaccines to countries with low governance scores. The combined governance score we developed may thus constitute a useful tool for helping philanthropic organizations make decisions regarding the type of support needed by different countries to achieve success.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0013802"

These data were further used in partial budgeting and decision analysis to evaluate and compare the value of the control strategy. Overall, ITM was shown to be a cost-effective control option. While one ECF case was registered in the immunised group, 24 cases occurred amongst non-immunised calves. A significant negative association between immunisation and ECF cases occurrence was observed (p≤0.001). ECF mortality rate was also lower in the immunised group. However, as anti-theilerial treatment was given to all diseased calves, no significant negative association between immunisation and ECF mortality was found. Both groups showed an overall similar immunological pattern with high and increasing percentages of seropositive calves throughout the study. This, combined with the temporal distribution of cases in the non-immunised group, suggested the establishment of endemic stability. Furthermore, the economic analysis showed that ITM generated a profit estimated to be 7250 TZS (1 USD=1300 TZS) per vaccinated calf, and demonstrated that it was a better control measure than natural infection and subsequent treatment.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0167-5877(10)00267-9"

Household interviews were done with mothers from a random sample in March 2008 (237 households) and March 2009 (261 households).RESULTS: After the first year of vaccinations (three rounds), project households kept significantly more chickens and tended to be more food secure than control households. Mothers from project households ate significantly more eggs than their counterparts in control households. A similar trend was observed among children. In 2009, fewer chickens were vaccinated in the project villages than in 2008, and more chickens were independently vaccinated in the control villages. This corresponded with an increase in ownership of chickens, a reduction in food insecurity, and improved consumption of eggs in control villages, whereas chicken ownership and egg consumption decreased and food insecurity remained relatively stable in project villages. We saw no differences between project and control villages in income earned from chicken and egg sales.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that an increase in chicken Newcastle disease vaccination can lead to an increase in ownership of chickens and egg consumption and may also have an effect on reducing household food insecurity.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20973464"

It is the only etiological treatment of envenomations by snakes or scorpions. Immunotherapy is based on administration of antibodies produced by an animal hyperimmunised against venom. Improvement of whole antivenomous sera was obtained, first by separating the antibodies from other components of blood plasma, then by using enzyme digestion of immunoglobulins G and, finally, by purifying the final product. Efficacy and also tolerance were significantly increased. Antivenom administration should be performed through the intravascular route to ensure better diffusion and to facilitate the complexion with the venom. The sale of antivenoms, in particular in Africa, is considerably reduced since about thirty years and is not in adequacy with the epidemiologic needs. In addition to the high cost of the current products, the difficulties of supplying, storage and use seem at the origin of this rejection by both the health staff and the victims who resort massively to traditional medicine. Whereas WHO reminds the rules of production and use of the antivenoms to producers and authorities in charge of drug regulations, it appears that the accessibility of the antivenoms depends on a concerted effort from all the actors, coordinated by health authorities: producers, distributers, manufacturers and public. Beyond technological improvements necessary in antivenom production, the strategy to be implemented must include the strict evaluation of the needs based on epidemiologic studies, the share of cost recovery between all the actors, and the optimization of the therapeutic protocol to make it applicable in remote health centres. Once confidence towards immunotherapy will be restored, mortality will be significantly reduced.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1051/jbio/2009042"

Prevention of human rabies is accomplished by controlling rabies in domestic and wild animals, including the use of vaccination programs. The usefulness of human rabies vaccines is hampered by high cost, complicated vaccination regimens and lack of compliance, especially in areas of Africa and Asia where human rabies infections are endemic. A single-dose vaccine would greatly benefit efforts to combat this global health threat. However, a single-dose vaccine based on current inactivated vaccines does not appear feasible and other approaches are needed. Technology has advanced since modern human rabies vaccines were developed over 40 years ago. In addition, our understanding of immunological principles that influence the outcome of vaccination has increased. This article describes the current status of inactivated rabies virus vaccines and recent developments arising from the use of reverse genetics technologies designed to develop replication-deficient or single-cycle live rabies virus-based vectors for use as a single-dose rabies vaccine for humans.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1586/erv.10.105"

Due to the presence of Anopheles, Aedes, and Culex mosquitoes, travel to these destinations poses a risk for diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis that cause significant morbidity and mortality. To gain a better understanding of the major emerging and established travel-related infectious diseases transmitted principally by mosquitoes and the measures for their prevention in U.S. residents who travel to these developing countries, we performed a literature search of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases (January 1950-February 2010). Information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization and relevant references from the publications identified were also reviewed. Vaccines for the prevention of Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever are commercially available to U.S. travelers and should be administered when indicated. However, the prevention of malaria, dengue fever, chikungunya, and West Nile virus relies on personal insect protection measures and chemoprophylaxis for malaria. As the rate of international travel continues to rise, individuals traveling overseas should be made aware of the risk of various infectious diseases and the importance of prevention. Physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other practitioners can play a vital role in disease education and prevention, including the administration of vaccines and provision of chemoprophylactic drugs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1592/phco.30.10.1031"

We question the vaccine efficacy required before being considered in prevention strategies.DESIGN: We forecast the expected population-level impact of implementing circumcision among males compared with a 30% effective vaccine among males and females.METHODS: A mathematical transmission model was developed to describe the HIV epidemics in two different settings, Thailand and South Africa, and to forecast the expected impact of circumcision or vaccine interventions.RESULTS: Interventions using a vaccine with 30% efficacy would likely have a greater population benefit than male circumcision because a proportion of males are already circumcised, thus diminishing the potential target population. Both males and females will receive considerable benefit from vaccination (for example, 33% of infections averted for males and 36% for females in South Africa), whereas females will receive only moderate benefit from male circumcision (for example, 47% of infections averted for males and 19% for females in South Africa). In both settings, it would likely take a number of years before the interventions could have a noticeable impact on HIV epidemics.CONCLUSION: A moderately effective vaccine, such as the one demonstrated in the RV144 trial, may have a potential role in public health programs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/QAD.0b013e32833ead96"

Our objective was to assess the potential impact of PCVs of different valences in The Gambia.METHODS: We synthesized the best available epidemiological and cost data using a state-transition model to simulate the natural histories of various pneumococcal diseases. For the base-case, we estimated incremental cost (in 2005 US dollars) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted under routine vaccination using PCV9 compared to no vaccination. We extended the base-case results for PCV9 to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13, each compared to no vaccination. To explore parameter uncertainty, we performed both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We also explored the impact of vaccine efficacy waning, herd immunity, and serotype replacement, as a part of the uncertainty analyses, by assuming alternative scenarios and extrapolating empirical results from different settings.RESULTS: Assuming 90% coverage, a program using a 9-valent PCV (PCV9) would prevent approximately 630 hospitalizations, 40 deaths, and 1000 DALYs, over the first 5 years of life of a birth cohort. Under base-case assumptions ($3.5 per vaccine), compared to no intervention, a PCV9 vaccination program would cost $670 per DALY averted in The Gambia. The corresponding values for PCV7, PCV10, and PCV13 were $910, $670, and $570 per DALY averted, respectively. Sensitivity analyses that explored the implications of the uncertain key parameters showed that model outcomes were most sensitive to vaccine price per dose, discount rate, case-fatality rate of primary endpoint pneumonia, and vaccine efficacy against primary endpoint pneumonia.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the information available now, infant PCV vaccination would be expected to reduce pneumococcal diseases caused by S. pneumoniae in The Gambia. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of three times GDP per capita, all PCVs examined would be cost-effective at the tentative Advance Market Commitment (AMC) price of $3.5 per dose. Because the cost-effectiveness of a PCV program could be affected by potential serotype replacement or herd immunity effects that may not be known until after a large scale introduction, type-specific surveillance and iterative evaluation will be critical.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2334-10-260"

Rabies and other lyssaviruses have been found in unexpected places, and human disease, especially paralytic rabies, has gone unrecognised. Evidence is emerging that rabies-related bat lyssaviruses are enzootic across Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, but none has been detected in the Americas. The epidemiology and origins of African lyssaviruses are discussed. Ideal rabies prophylaxis (pre-exposure immunisation followed by post-exposure booster vaccination) has proved 100% effective; hence all human deaths result from failure of prevention. Rabies vaccines of known quality are unaffordable for the majority in Africa. Although intradermal regimens requiring &lt;40% of the usual vaccine dose are economical and are recommended by the World Health Organization, several problems have inhibited their use. A new, simplified, economical post-exposure vaccine regimen that uses an initial dose of intradermal injections at four sites overcomes many of the difficulties of the previous methods: it is at least as immunogenic as the standard intramuscular course of tissue-culture vaccine; is safer in inexperienced hands; requires fewer than two ampoules of vaccine and only three instead of five clinic visits. Recent data should increase the confidence of physicians to use the World Health Organization-accredited rabies vaccines more efficiently and at lower cost.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0924-8579(10)00262-1"

An important and sustainable reduction in malaria burden cannot be achieved unless an effective and inexpensive malaria vaccine becomes available.OBJECTIVES: The goals of this study were to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) for 3 hypothetical malaria vaccines with different levels of protection (in years), effectiveness, and adverse effects; and to identify factors that influence the price that people are willing to pay in Nigeria.METHODS: With the aid of a questionnaire, a contingent valuation method using payment cards was used to elicit WTP values for 3 hypothetical malaria vaccines. Payment cards contained both a description of the features of the vaccine being evaluated and price options. The 3 hypothetical vaccines had the following characteristics: vaccine A was 75% effective, protected for 3 years, and was well tolerated; vaccine B was 85% effective, protected for 6 years, and was less well tolerated than vaccine A; and vaccine C was 95% effective and protected for 12 years, but was the least well tolerated. Participants consisted of a convenience sample of individuals who were at the pharmacy waiting area of the state-owned hospitals located in Benin City and Warri, Nigeria. Every third patient or caregiver who was in the pharmacy to fill a prescription was asked to take part in the study as they waited to see the pharmacist. If consent was not granted, the next person in line was approached to be interviewed. Linear multiple regression analysis and nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, or chi(2) test was applied in inferential analysis, where necessary, to investigate the effects of sociodemographic factors on WTP. Prices on payment cards were expressed in Nigerian naira (NGN 150.00 approximately US $1.00), but study results were expressed in US dollars.RESULTS: A total of 359 individuals aged &gt; or =18 years of 500 who were approached agreed to participate in the study, giving a response rate of 71.8%. Most of the participants (216/359; 60.2%) were women, and 48 of them were pregnant. Most respondents (299/359; 83.3%) had at least one malaria attack within the last year, and 27.3% (98/359) were hospitalized for malaria. The mean WTP for vaccine A was $6.77 and that for vaccine B was $6.70. Vaccine C was the least well accepted with a mean WTP of $5.06. Respondents were willing to pay significantly more for vaccine A (95% CI, $5.96-$7.57); thus, the WTP was significantly different for the 3 hypothetical malaria vaccines (P &lt; 0.001; Kruskal-Wallis statistic [kw] = 84.304). Dunn's multiple comparison test also indicated that the WTP values for vaccines A and B were significantly different from each other (P &lt; 0.05). There was also a significant difference between vaccine A or B versus C (P &lt; 0.001). All workers and those with a higher monthly income were willing to pay significantly more for vaccines A and B, but less for C (P &lt; 0.003). Those who preferred vaccine A (198/359; 55.2%) were willing to back their choice with a higher WTP (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: It appears that although malaria is a serious disease, the Nigerian people in this sample preferred and were willing to pay more for a vaccine that was well tolerated, even if its effectiveness and duration of protection against malaria were lower than those of a product that caused severe adverse effects. Interpretation of this study should be guided by the knowledge that differences exist between the study sample and the general population.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0149-2918(10)00257-2"

In addition to prevention of new cancers by reduction of risk factors, strategies are needed to close the gap between developed and developing countries in cancer survival and the effects of the disease on human suffering. We challenge the public health community's assumption that cancers will remain untreated in poor countries, and note the analogy to similarly unfounded arguments from more than a decade ago against provision of HIV treatment. In resource-constrained countries without specialised services, experience has shown that much can be done to prevent and treat cancer by deployment of primary and secondary caregivers, use of off-patent drugs, and application of regional and global mechanisms for financing and procurement. Furthermore, several middle-income countries have included cancer treatment in national health insurance coverage with a focus on people living in poverty. These strategies can reduce costs, increase access to health services, and strengthen health systems to meet the challenge of cancer and other diseases. In 2009, we formed the Global Task Force on Expanded Access to Cancer Care and Control in Developing Countries, which is composed of leaders from the global health and cancer care communities, and is dedicated to proposal, implementation, and evaluation of strategies to advance this agenda.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0140-6736(10)61152-X"

Estimates attribute up to 33,000 deaths annually to rotavirus disease in Nigerian children &lt;5 years old. Although the introduction of the new oral, live attenuated rotavirus vaccines may not occur for another 4-6 years in developing countries, background data on burden of disease, cost of rotavirus disease, and characterization of circulating strains is required to hasten this introduction to children who would clearly benefit from the intervention.METHODS: Between July 2002 and July 2004, fecal specimens were collected from 869 infants and young children &lt;5 years of age presenting with diarrhea in Kaduna, Kebbi, Sokoto, and Zamfara states in northwestern Nigeria. In addition, 194 control specimens were also collected from children matched for age. Specimens were screened for the presence of rotavirus antigens. Rotavirus-positive specimens were further analyzed to determine electropherotype, subgroup specificity, and G and P genotypes.RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 18% of children with diarrhea and 7.2% of the age-matched case control subjects. The highest rotavirus burden was detected in children aged &lt;6 months. The majority of the rotavirus-positive specimens revealed viruses of long electropherotypes, subgroup II specificity, and G1P[8] genotypes. Furthermore, more than a quarter of specimens (37%) displayed mixed G and P genotypes, and almost a third could not be genotyped.CONCLUSIONS: The high numbers of mixed rotavirus infections highlight the multitude of enteric pathogens to which children in African countries are exposed. Data on circulating rotavirus strains serve to inform African government officials to the serious health threat posed by rotavirus in their respective countries and to document the diversity of strains before vaccine introduction.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1086/653570"

Although a rotavirus vaccine will reduce rotavirus diarrheal morbidity and mortality, its introduction and sustainability will incur considerable costs. The aim of this study was to estimate the costs associated with diarrheal disease of all etiologies in children &lt;5 years of age at Dr George Mukhari Hospital, a tertiary level hospital in Gauteng, South Africa.METHODS: Cost data were obtained by a review of systematically selected records of patients admitted for diarrhea during 2004 and the prospective recording of the treatment of consecutive inpatients admitted for diarrhea from February through June 2005. Data on hospital stay, medications, nondrug orders, and diagnostic tests were abstracted using standardized recording forms. Costs were calculated using 2004 and 2005 prices. Carers were interviewed using a standard interview schedule to determine out-of-pocket expenses. Stool samples were tested for rotavirus by the Medical Research Council Diarrheal Pathogens Unit.RESULTS: The review sample comprised 86 (20 rotavirus positive) patient records. The prospective sample comprised 77 inpatients (25 rotavirus positive). The mean duration (+/- standard deviation [SD]) of hospital stay was 4.6 +/- 3.4 days and 5.7 +/- 4.7 days for the review and prospective samples, respectively. The mean total inpatient cost (+/-SD) was R5963 +/- R4070 (review sample) and R7256 +/- R5599 (prospective sample; P &gt; .05). Although mean total costs did not differ significantly between rotavirus-negative and -positive samples, mean facility and antibiotic costs were significantly higher for the rotavirus-negative sample (P &lt; .05) in the prospective sample. Mean out-of-pocket expenses (+/-SD) were R100.00 +/- R112 for inpatients.CONCLUSION: Although total inpatient costs did not differ significantly between the rotavirus-negative and -positive patients, costs for the rotavirus-negative patients tended to be higher. Although a rotavirus vaccine will reduce the burden of diarrheal disease, it is imperative that measures for reducing the incidence and severity of diarrheal disease due to other pathogens are strengthened.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1086/653560"

With GAVI Alliance cofinancing, adoption of Rotarix would be associated with a cost of $5.07 per disability-adjusted life-year averted. With market pricing, Rotarix would be associated with a base case cost of $74.73 per disability-adjusted life-year averted. Key variables influencing results were vaccine efficacy, under-2 rotavirus mortality, and program cost of administering each dose.CONCLUSIONS: Adopting Rotarix would likely be highly cost-effective for Malawi, particularly with GAVI support.

During a national immunization campaign in Mozambique, vouchers, which were to be redeemed at a later date for free ITNs, were distributed in Manica and Sofala provinces. A survey to evaluate ITN ownership and usage post-campaign was conducted.METHODS: Four districts in each province and four enumeration areas (EAs) in each district were selected using probability proportional to size. Within each EA, 32 households (HHs) were selected using a simple random sample. Interviews to assess ownership and usage were conducted in each of the selected HHs using personal digital assistants.RESULTS: Valid interviews were completed for 947 (92.5%) (440 in Manica and 507 in Sofala) of the 1,024 selected HHs.

By 5 years of age virtually every child worldwide will have experienced at least one rotavirus infection. This leads to an enormous disease burden, where every minute a child dies because of rotavirus infection and another four are hospitalized, at an annual societal cost in 2007 of $US2 billion. Most of the annual 527 000 deaths are in malnourished infants living in rural regions of low and middle income countries. In contrast, most measurable costs arise from medical expenses and lost parental wages in high income countries. Vaccines are the only public health prevention strategy likely to control rotavirus disease. They were developed to mimic the immunity following natural rotavirus infection that confers protection against severe gastroenteritis and consequently reduces the risk of primary healthcare utilization, hospitalization and death. The two currently licensed vaccines--one a single human strain rotavirus vaccine, the other a multiple strain human-bovine pentavalent reassortant rotavirus vaccine--are administered to infants in a two- or three-dose course, respectively, with the first dose given at 6-14 weeks of age. In various settings they are safe, immunogenic and efficacious against many different rotavirus genotypes. In high and middle income countries, rotavirus vaccines confer 85-100% protection against severe disease, while in low income regions of Africa and Asia, protection is less, at 46-77%. Despite this reduced efficacy in low income countries, the high burden of diarrheal disease in these regions means that proportionately more severe cases are prevented by vaccination than elsewhere. Post-licensure effectiveness studies show that rotavirus vaccines not only reduce rotavirus activity in infancy but they also decrease rates of rotavirus diarrhea in older and unimmunized children. A successful rotavirus vaccination program will rely upon sustained vaccine efficacy against diverse and evolving rotavirus strains and efficient vaccine delivery systems. The potential introduction of rotavirus vaccines into the world's poorest countries with the greatest rates of rotavirus-related mortality is expected to be very cost effective, while rotavirus vaccines should also be cost effective by international standards when incorporated into developed countries immunization schedules. Nonetheless, cost effectiveness in each country still depends largely on the local rotavirus mortality rate and the price of the vaccine in relation to the per capita gross domestic product.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=3"

The Widal test is widely used in Africa but little information exists about its reliability.METHODS: We assessed the performance of the Widal tube agglutination test among febrile hospitalized Tanzanian children. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of various anti-TH and -TO titers using culture-confirmed typhoid fever cases as the &quot;true positives&quot; and all other febrile children with blood culture negative for S. typhi as the &quot;true negatives.&quot;RESULTS: We found that 16 (1%) of 1,680 children had culture-proven typhoid fever.

To date, there have been limited data on the cost-effectiveness of this strategy using sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) and no published data on cost-effectiveness using other antimalarials.METHODS: We analysed data from 5 countries in sub-Saharan Africa using a total of 5 different IPTi drug regimens; SP, mefloquine (MQ), 3 days of chlorproguanil-dapsone (CD), SP plus 3 days of artesunate (SP-AS3) and 3 days of amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ3-AS3).The cost per malaria episode averted and cost per Disability-Adjusted Life-Year (DALY) averted were modeled using both trial specific protective efficacy (PE) for all IPTi drugs and a pooled PE for IPTi with SP, malaria incidence, an estimated malaria case fatality rate of 1.57%, IPTi delivery costs and country specific provider and household malaria treatment costs.FINDINGS: In sites where IPTi had a significant effect on reducing malaria, the cost per episode averted for IPTi-SP was very low, USD 1.36-4.03 based on trial specific data and USD 0.68-2.27 based on the pooled analysis. For IPTi using alternative antimalarials, the lowest cost per case averted was for AQ3-AS3 in western Kenya (USD 4.62) and the highest was for MQ in Korowge, Tanzania (USD 18.56). Where efficacious, based only on intervention costs, IPTi was shown to be cost effective in all the sites and highly cost-effective in all but one of the sites, ranging from USD 2.90 (Ifakara, Tanzania with SP) to USD 39.63 (Korogwe, Tanzania with MQ) per DALY averted. In addition, IPTi reduced health system costs and showed significant savings to households from malaria cases averted. A threshold analysis showed that there is room for the IPTi-efficacy to fall and still remain highly cost effective in all sites where IPTi had a statistically significant effect on clinical malaria.CONCLUSIONS: IPTi delivered alongside the EPI is a highly cost effective intervention against clinical malaria with a range of drugs in a range of malaria transmission settings. Where IPTi did not have a statistically significant impact on malaria, generally in low transmission sites, it was not cost effective.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0010313"

Characteristics of the households and of the interviewed women and men were tabulated. The number of correct answers given to the health knowledge and practice questions and their percentage distribution were tabulated by items and by gender. An overall health knowledge score was derived.RESULTS: There are low levels of appropriate knowledge on child health, some inappropriate practices and generally low vaccination coverage. Health knowledge scores improve significantly amongst those who have accessed higher education. Differences in health knowledge between women and men become insignificant once age and education are accounted for.CONCLUSIONS: Health education activities should be an integral part of a package to improve child survival in rural Guinea Bissau. These activities should focus on diarrhoea, malaria, pneumonia, pregnancy, delivery, neonatal care and vaccination coverage, as these are areas where knowledge and practices were found to be inadequate in this study. Men as well as women should be involved in these activities. Prior to developing health education interventions in similar settings, studies to assess areas to be targeted should be conducted.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-10-319"

The survey included both questionnaire survey and a participatory group discussion. A total of 225 households (45 households from each of five Woredas) were interviewed. The questionnaire was designed to collect data covering general information on village poultry production such as socio-management characteristics, production objectives, population structure, breed choice and trait preferences, market preferences of specific traits, and farmers' selection practices. The participatory farmers' discussions were designed to involve stakeholders in defining the breeding objective &quot;traits&quot; and deriving their relative importance in the production environment based on the different functions of chickens and &quot;traits&quot; identified in the interviews. The results showed that production of eggs for consumption is the principal function of chickens in most regions followed by the use as source of income and meat for home consumption. The production system in all geographic regions studied revealed similar features generally characterized by extensive scavenging management, absence of immunization programs, increased risk of exposure of birds to disease and predators, and reproduction entirely based on uncontrolled natural mating and hatching of eggs using broody hens. Farmers' ratings of indigenous chickens with respect to modern breeds showed the highest significance of the adaptive traits in general, and the superior merits of indigenous chickens to high yielding exotic breeds in particular. Adaptation to the production environment was the most important attribute of chickens in all the study areas. The high significance attributed to reproduction traits indicates the need for maintaining broody behavior and high level of hatchability while breeding for improved productivity of indigenous chickens for village conditions. The market price of chickens is primarily dictated by weight, but farmers rated growth (males) and number of eggs followed by growth (females) as the production traits they would like the most to be improved. Therefore, the ultimate breeding goal should be to develop a dual-purpose breed based on indigenous chicken genetic resources with any of the comb types other than single for all the regions studied having the most preferred white body plumage for farmers in the Amhara region and red body plumage for those in Oromia, Benshangul-Gumuz, and Southern regions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s11250-010-9602-6"

Social mobilization (SM) has been a strategic component of the PEI. Yet, a close-up analysis of SM dynamics seems to be lacking in the health communication literature. We examine critical aspects of the PEI experience in an attempt to move from dominant informational perspectives to a focus on emerging challenges in polio eradication efforts and new levels of complexity to SM. We examine available literature on communication and public health, available data on SM experiences that support polio eradication in Africa and Asia, and field work conducted by the authors where polio eradication efforts are ongoing. Our analysis suggests that (1) SM should not be casually approached as a top-down informational strategy to advance pre-established health goals; (2) centralized strategies hardly amount to SM; and (3) hybrid options that combine both activist and pragmatic SM are concrete possibilities for global health initiatives. In the context of renewed global democratization and persistent conflicts rooted in ethnicity, religion, and economics, it cannot be assumed that communities will either diligently espouse global goals or necessarily oppose them. Communication and SM strategies should rely on a clear understanding of the motives and agendas of involved actors. Resistance or opposition are important analytical dimensions as they may uncover new opportunities for effective health interventions. Further studies using these perspectives should be a priority for global health programs, including studies of the trust level, or lack thereof, among social actors.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=922042994"

In this paper, we evaluate the technical feasibility of interventions to control aflatoxin risk, to be potentially deployed in parts of Africa where aflatoxin exposure poses a significant public health concern. We have applied a conceptual framework for feasibility to four interventions, one associated with each of four different stages of aflatoxin risk: biocontrol (pre-harvest), a post-harvest intervention package (post-harvest), NovaSil clay (dietary), and hepatitis B vaccination (clinical). For each intervention, we have assessed the following four components of technical feasibility: (1) characteristics of the basic intervention, (2) characteristics of delivery, (3) requirements on government capacity, and (4) usage characteristics. We propose ways in which feasibility of each intervention is currently high or low from the perspective of adoption in Africa, how public education is crucial for each of these interventions to succeed, and how to align economic incentives to make the interventions more suitable for less developed countries.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=922046405"

Magnetic immunochromatography testing (MICT) uses a standard lateral-flow platform that incorporates magnetic-bead conjugates for quantitative measurement of the magnetic field distortion associated with the bound magnetic conjugate (reported as adjusted relative magnetic units [MAR]). The results of the optimized MICT assay were compared to standard enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and Western blotting (WB) results using a blinded 649-member panel of specimens from the United States, Cameroon, and West Africa. The panel was comprised of samples from individuals infected with various HIV-1 subtypes (n = 234) or HIV-2 (n = 65) and HIV-seronegative specimens (n = 350). Additionally, 13 HIV-1 seroconversion panels (total specimens = 85), a worldwide panel containing seven of the major circulating HIV-1 subtypes (n = 18), an HIV-2 panel, an HIV-1/HIV-2 mixed panel, and 100 prospective specimens were tested with completely concordant results.

Because of the devastating nature of the disease there is an urgent need to develop new drugs or vaccines for the treatment, prevention and management of the disease. The objective of the present study was to collect and document information on herbal remedies traditionally used for the treatment of malaria in the Dangme West District of Ghana.METHODS: Data was collected from 67 indigenous households in ten communities in the district using a validated questionnaire.RESULTS: In total, 30 species of plants belonging to 28 genera in 20 families were reported to be used in the preparation of the herbal remedies. Mature leaves were the most (55%) common plant part used and 73.3% of the herbal remedies involved a single plant. Most of the herbal remedies were prepared by boiling and administered orally. The majority (47%) of the species of plants used were collected from their compounds or home gardens.CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about malaria and treatment practices exists in the study area. Herbal remedies were commonly used by people for the treatment of malaria because they were cost-effective. They are also more accessible.

Distance to health facilities is a known determinant of health care utilization and may drive inequalities in health outcomes; we aimed to investigate its effects on childhood mortality.METHODS: The Epidemiological and Demographic Surveillance System in Kilifi District, Kenya, collects data on vital events and migrations in a population of 220,000 people. We used Geographic Information Systems to estimate pedestrian and vehicular travel times to hospitals and vaccine clinics and developed proportional-hazards models to evaluate the effects of travel time on mortality hazard in children less than 5 years of age, accounting for sex, ethnic group, maternal education, migrant status, rainfall and calendar time.RESULTS: In 2004-6, under-5 and under-1 mortality ratios were 65 and 46 per 1,000 live-births, respectively. Median pedestrian and vehicular travel times to hospital were 193 min (inter-quartile range: 125-267) and 49 min (32-72); analogous values for vaccine clinics were 47 (25-73) and 26 min (13-40). Infant and under-5 mortality varied two-fold across geographic locations, ranging from 34.5 to 61.9 per 1000 child-years and 8.8 to 18.1 per 1000, respectively. However, distance to health facilities was not associated with mortality. Hazard Ratios (HR) were 0.99 (95% CI 0.95-1.04) per hour and 1.01 (95% CI 0.95-1.08) per half-hour of pedestrian and vehicular travel to hospital, respectively, and 1.00 (95% CI 0.99-1.04) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.92-1.05) per quarter-hour of pedestrian and vehicular travel to vaccine clinics in children &lt;5 years of age.CONCLUSIONS: Significant spatial variations in mortality were observed across the area, but were not correlated with distance to health facilities. We conclude that given the present density of health facilities in Kenya, geographic access to curative services does not influence population-level mortality.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-10-142"

Until recently, ownership and use of insecticides treated nets (ITNs) in most countries was low and inequitable, although coverage has increased in countries where free ITN distribution is integrated into mass vaccination campaigns. In Kenya, free ITNs were distributed to children aged below five years in 2006 through two mass campaigns. High and equitable coverage were reported after the campaigns in some districts, although national level coverage remained low, suggesting that understanding barriers to access remains important. This study was conducted to explore barriers to ownership and use of ITNs among the poorest populations before and after the mass campaigns, to identify strategies for improving coverage, and to make recommendations on how increased coverage levels can be sustained.METHODS: The study was conducted in the poorest areas of four malaria endemic districts in Kenya. Multiple data collection methods were applied including: cross-sectional surveys (n = 708 households), 24 focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews with 70 ITN suppliers.RESULTS: Affordability was reported as a major barrier to access but non-financial barriers were also shown to be important determinants. On the demand side key barriers to access included: mismatch between the types of ITNs supplied through interventions and community preferences; perceptions and beliefs on illness causes; physical location of suppliers and; distrust in free delivery and in the distribution agencies. Key barriers on the supply side included: distance from manufacturers; limited acceptability of ITNs provided through interventions; crowding out of the commercial sector and the price. Infrastructure, information and communication played a central role in promoting or hindering access.CONCLUSIONS: Significant resources have been directed towards addressing affordability barriers through providing free ITNs to vulnerable groups, but the success of these interventions depends largely on the degree to which other barriers to access are addressed. Only if additional efforts are directed towards addressing non-financial barriers to access, will high coverage levels be achieved and sustained.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-10-137"

Infection caused by P. falciparum is the most serious of all the other species (P. ovale, P. vivax and P. malariae) especially in terms of morbidity and mortality hence the reason why most of the research has been focussed on this species. The disease affects up to about 40 per cent of the world's population with around 300-500 million people currently infected and mainly in the tropics. It has a high morbidity and mortality especially in resource-poor tropical and subtropical regions with an economic fall of about US$ 12 billion annually in Africa alone.METHOD: relevant literatures were reviewed from medical journals, library search and internet source. Other relevant websites like PATH, Malaria Vaccine Initiative and Global Fund were also visited to source for information. The key words employed were: malaria, vaccine, anopheles mosquito, insecticide treated bed-nets, pyrethroids and Plasmodium.RESULTS: several studies have underscored the need to develop an effective human malaria vaccine for the control and possible eradication of malaria across the globe with the view to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, improve on the social and economic losses and also protect those at risk.CONCLUSION: It is very obvious that the need for effective human malaria vaccine is not only to serve those living in malaria endemic regions but also the non-immune travellers especially those travelling to malaria endemic areas; this would offer cost effective means of preventing the disease, reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with it in addition to closing the gap left by other control measures. It is very obvious that there is no single control measure known to be effective in the control of malaria, hence the need for combination of more than one method with the aim of achieving synergy in the total control and possible eradication of the disease. It suffices to say that despite the use of combination of more than one method (e.g., drugs treating patients, breaking the life cycle of the vector mosquito using larvicides, clearing swamps and other mosquito breeding sites), no much progress was made towards achieving this goal, hence the renewed interest especially with regards to vaccine development.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20232750"

We address each of these issues in turn, presenting data from field studies and modelling approaches used in Tanzania, including burden of disease evaluations, detailed epidemiological studies, operational data from vaccination campaigns in different demographic and ecological settings, and economic analyses of the cost-effectiveness of dog vaccination for human rabies prevention.SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that there are no insurmountable problems to canine rabies control in most of Africa; that elimination of canine rabies is epidemiologically and practically feasible through mass vaccination of domestic dogs; and that domestic dog vaccination provides a cost-effective approach to the prevention and elimination of human rabies deaths.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000626"

In Ethiopia, a decline was observed in under-five mortality rates from 204 to 123 per 1000 live births between 1990 and 2005, showing good progress towards the achievement of MDG4. A downward trend was observed in the maternal mortality ratio; however, because of the high degree of sampling variability, it is not possible to reach any firm conclusion about the possibility of achieving MDG5. Regarding MDG6, good progress was observed in controlling HIV/AIDS and malaria, whereas MDG indicators related to tuberculosis are still below international standards. Therefore, performance was not uniform across programmes. In general, interventions that can be routinely scheduled, such as immunisation, had much higher coverage than those that rely on functional health systems and clinical services proximate to households with 24h availability, such as skilled care at birth. These mixed results highlight that, although MDGs focus on specific diseases and conditions, targets cannot be achieved without strengthening health systems. It is for this reason that the strategic health plan in Ethiopia is focusing on high-impact and cost-effective health interventions and on health systems strengthening.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0035-9203(09)00402-7"

In Rwanda, where adult HIV prevalence is 3%, MC is not a traditional practice. The Rwanda National AIDS Commission modelled cost and effects of MC at different ages to inform policy and programmatic decisions in relation to introducing MC. This study was necessary because the MC debate in Southern Africa has focused primarily on MC for adults. Further, this is the first time, to our knowledge, that a cost-effectiveness study on MC has been carried out in a country where HIV prevalence is below 5%.METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed and applied to three hypothetical cohorts in Rwanda: newborns, adolescents, and adult men. Effectiveness was defined as the number of HIV infections averted, and was calculated as the product of the number of people susceptible to HIV infection in the cohort, the HIV incidence rate at different ages, and the protective effect of MC; discounted back to the year of circumcision and summed over the life expectancy of the circumcised person. Direct costs were based on interviews with experienced health care providers to determine inputs involved in the procedure (from consumables to staff time) and related prices. Other costs included training, patient counselling, treatment of adverse events, and promotion campaigns, and they were adjusted for the averted lifetime cost of health care (antiretroviral therapy [ART], opportunistic infection [OI], laboratory tests). One-way sensitivity analysis was performed by varying the main inputs of the model, and thresholds were calculated at which each intervention is no longer cost-saving and at which an intervention costs more than one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per life-year gained.RESULTS: Neonatal MC is less expensive than adolescent and adult MC (US$15 instead of US$59 per procedure) and is cost-saving (the cost-effectiveness ratio is negative), even though savings from infant circumcision will be realized later in time. The cost per infection averted is US$3,932 for adolescent MC and US$4,949 for adult MC. Results for infant MC appear robust. Infant MC remains highly cost-effective across a reasonable range of variation in the base case scenario. Adolescent MC is highly cost-effective for the base case scenario but this high cost-effectiveness is not robust to small changes in the input variables. Adult MC is neither cost-saving nor highly cost-effective when considering only the direct benefit for the circumcised man.CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that Rwanda should be simultaneously scaling up circumcision across a broad range of age groups, with high priority to the very young. Infant MC can be integrated into existing health services (i.e., neonatal visits and vaccination sessions) and over time has better potential than adolescent and adult circumcision to achieve the very high coverage of the population required for maximal reduction of HIV incidence. In the presence of infant MC, adolescent and adult MC would evolve into a &quot;catch-up&quot; campaign that would be needed at the start of the program but would eventually become superfluous.

We use patch-occupancy models to quantify the contribution of sub-populations to disease occurrence (&quot;risk&quot;) and model allocation strategies for a limited number of vaccine doses that prioritize villages based on their size, risk, or the reduction in risk for the entire population that would result from vaccination. We assume that a maximum of 70% of susceptible individuals in a village could be vaccinated, and that only susceptible dogs are vaccinated. The most effective strategy maximised the reduction in risk of the entire population, and was up to 62% more effective than the other strategies. Large, single-pulse campaigns provided the greatest short-term protection, but higher frequencies of smaller pulses were more effective at reducing long-term disease occurrence. Vaccine allocation on a per-dose basis was substantially more effective than a per-village strategy, indicating that operational constraints can reduce control effectiveness. The spatial distribution and abundance of hosts have an important influence on disease dynamics and these results demonstrate that metapopulation models can be used to substantially improve the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and optimize the allocation of limited control resources.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)01987-6"

For other high prevalence NTDs, including hookworm infection, schistosomiasis, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, new drugs and vaccines may still be required. Increasingly it is recognized that the high prevalence NTDs exhibit extensive geographic overlap and polyparasitism is commonly found throughout the world's low income countries. Therefore, global elimination will also require integrated packages of drugs together with vaccine-linked chemotherapy. Ultimately, the global elimination of the high prevalence NTDs will require continued large-scale support from the U.S. Government and selected European governments, however, the emerging market economies, such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Nigeria, and wealthy countries in the Middle East will also have to substantially contribute.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)00888-7"

The 40 plus field staff were directed by a Regional Office in Lagos, Nigeria and a headquarters group in Atlanta, Georgia. The teams greatly expanded the knowledge of smallpox epidemiology, helped to expand the capabilities of Ministries of Health, pioneered the use of jet injectors to provide millions of immunizations, and expanded the use of surveillance/containment to become a primary strategy for interrupting smallpox transmission. Smallpox transmission was interrupted in three and one half years, a year and a half before the time targeted and under budget.

The success with eradicating smallpox gave confidence for initiating the eradication of other diseases, such as malaria and polio. However, these efforts have not been as effective, as recorded for small pox, for a variety of reasons. There is now a debate within the global health community as to whether eradication campaigns should be abandoned in favor of less costly and perhaps more effective primary health and containment or control programmes. Significant changes that have taken place in the last thirty years, since the eradication of smallpox include, among others, (i) post-colonial political changes, with varying commitment to disease eradication initiatives, especially in the parts of the world most burdened by infectious and vaccine preventable diseases, (ii) innovations leading to the development of new and highly effective vaccines, targeted to specific diseases, (iii) the transformation brought about by improvement in education and the new global access to information (cell phones, internet, etc.), leading to an unlimited access to different types of information, subject to either positive or negative use. At the onset of eradication of smallpox, global health was confined in its operation. Today, global health is at the intersection of medical and social science disciplines-including demography, economics, epidemiology, political economy and sociology. Therefore, in considering the issue of disease eradication, medical and social perspectives must be brought into play, if future eradication programmes must succeed. The paper discusses the roles of these disciplines in disease control and eradication, especially as it affects sub Saharan Africa, the melting pot and verdant pasture of infectious diseases.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)01409-5"

Neonatal screening is a preventive action that reduces the rates of mortality due to complications arising from infections by encouraging early prophylactic penicillin use and pneumococcal vaccination. The purpose of this pilot study was to set up a neonatal screening protocol at a lower cost than one that uses commercially available screening kits.DESIGN AND SETTING: Pilot study conducted over 1 year in two Tunis maternity hospitals.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples from 9148 newborns were collected using paper printed using a common office printer to collect blood spots from the newborns. A lab-prepared agarose gel for isoelectrofocusing (IEF) was used to test the dried blood samples from these newborns.RESULTS: The IEF on lab-prepared agarose gels was efficient since it was able to detect the main abnormal Hbs previously identified in the Tunisian population (HbS, HbC, HbO, and HbG). Furthermore, when data collected in this screening program were compared with the previously established national data, no statistically significant differences were found. After analysis, results were given back to the families of the patients, and the major Hb cases were directed to one of the hemoglobinopathies specialized centers, where at-risk couples benefited from genetic counselling and were informed about the possibility of prenatal diagnosis.CONCLUSION: This pilot experiment demonstrated the feasibility of SCD neonatal detection using a lower cost method as well as detection of other main structural Hb variants.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.5144/0256-4947.2012.49"

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and EVPI were computed from weighted averages of outputs using two different assignments of the EIR distribution in 2007. Uncertainty was evaluated by resampling of epidemiological, vaccination, and health systems model parameters.RESULTS: Health benefits were predicted consistently only at low transmission, and program costs always substantially exceeded case management savings. Optimal cost-effectiveness was at EIR of about 10 infectious bites per annum (ibpa). Main contributors to ICER uncertainty were uncertainty in transmission intensity, price per vaccine dose, decay rate of the vaccine effect, degree of homogeneity in host response, and some epidemiological model parameters. Other health system costs were unimportant. With a ceiling ratio of 207 international dollars per disability-adjusted life-year averted, 52.4% of parameterizations predicted cost-effectiveness in the primary analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of RTS,S will be maximal in low endemicity settings (EIR 2-20 ibpa). Widespread deployment of other transmission-reducing interventions will thus improve cost-effectiveness, suggesting a selective introduction strategy. EVPI is substantial. Accrual of up-to-date information on local endemicity to guide deployment decisions would be highly efficient.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S1098-3015(11)01526-9"

The aim of this study was to evaluate trends in IPD hospitalizations in HIV-infected adults in Soweto, South Africa, associated with up-scaling of the HAART program from 2003 to 2008.METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed IPD cases were identified from 2003 through 2008 through an existing surveillance program. The period 2003-04 was designated as the early-HAART era, 2005-06 as the intermediate-HAART era and 2007-08 as the established-HAART era. The incidence of IPD was compared between the early-HAART and established-HAART eras in HIV-infected and-uninfected individuals.RESULTS: A total of 2,567 IPD cases among individuals older than 18 years were reported from 2003 through 2008. Overall incidence of IPD (per 100,000) did not change during the study period in HIV-infected adults (207.4 cases in the early-HAART and 214.0 cases in the established-HAART era; p = 0.55). IPD incidence, actually increased 1.16-fold (95% CI: 1.01; 1.62) in HIV-infected females between the early-and established-HAART eras (212.1 cases and 246.2 cases, respectively; p = 0.03). The incidence of IPD remained unchanged in HIV-uninfected adults across the three time periods.CONCLUSION: Despite a stable prevalence of HIV and the increased roll-out of HAART for treatment of AIDS patients in our setting, the burden of IPD has not decreased among HIV-infected adults. The study indicates a need for ongoing monitoring of disease and HAART program effectiveness to reduce opportunistic infections in African adults with HIV/AIDS, as well as the need to consider alternate strategies including pneumococcal conjugate vaccine immunization for the prevention of IPD in HIV-infected adults.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0027929"

Vaccination is included among recommendations for cholera control. Cultural concepts of illness are likely to affect vaccine acceptance. This study examined social and cultural determinants of anticipated acceptance of an oral cholera vaccine (OCV) prior to a mass vaccination campaign in Zanzibar. Using a cultural epidemiological approach, 356 unaffected adult residents were studied with vignette-based semi-structured interviews. Anticipated acceptance was high for a free OCV (94%), but declined with increasing price. Logistic regression models examined social and cultural determinants of anticipated acceptance at low (USD 0.9), medium (USD 4.5) and high (USD 9) price. Models including somatic symptoms (low and high price), social impact (low and medium) and perceived causes (medium and high) explained anticipated OCV acceptance better than models containing only socio-demographic characteristics. Identifying thirst with cholera was positively associated with anticipated acceptance of the low-priced OCV, but acknowledging the value of home-based rehydration was negatively associated. Concern about spreading the infection to others was positively associated at low price among rural respondents. Confidence in the health system response to cholera outbreaks was negatively associated at medium price among peri-urban respondents. Identifying witchcraft as cause of cholera was negatively associated at medium and high price. Anticipated acceptance of free OCVs is nearly universal in cholera-endemic areas of Zanzibar; pre-intervention assessments of community demand for OCV should not only consider the social epidemiology, but also examine local socio-cultural features of cholera-like illness that explain vaccine acceptance.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=18012"

According to experts, the decision to vaccinate results from an individual risk assessment based on the duration of stay, the likelihood of engagement in at-risk activities, the age of the traveler, the rabies endemicity and access to appropriate medical care in the country of destination. However, no detailed information is available regarding the last two determinants in many regions. Twenty-two cases of rabies were reported in tourists, expatriates and migrant travelers over the last decade, including three cases following short-term travel of no more than two weeks. Studies on rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in travelers show that overall, 0.4% (range 0.01-2.3%) of travelers have experienced an at-risk bite per month of stay in a rabies-endemic country, while 31% of expatriates and 12% of tourists were vaccinated against rabies before traveling. The main reason cited by travelers for not being vaccinated is the cost of the vaccine. The majority of patients who sustained a high risk injury was not vaccinated against rabies before traveling and were not properly treated abroad. From available studies, the following risk factors for injuries sustained from potentially rabid animals may be identified: traveling to South-East Asia, India or North Africa, young age, and traveling for tourism. The duration of travel does not appear to be a risk factor. It should be noted that &quot;at-risk activities&quot; have not been addressed in these studies. Detailed rabies distribution maps and information on the availability of rabies biologics are urgently needed in order to identify those travelers who need pre-travel vaccination. Meanwhile, cost-minimization of rabies pre-exposure vaccination may be achieved in several ways, notably by using the intra-dermal method of vaccination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)01761-0"

Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are an effective intervention against malaria. ITN delivery through routine health services, such as antenatal care (ANC) and childhood vaccination (EPI), is a promising channel of delivery to reach individuals with the highest risk (pregnant women and children under five years old). Decisions on whether to deliver ITNs through both channels depends upon the reach of each of these systems, whether these are independent and the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of each. Predictors of women attending ANC and EPI separately have been studied, but the predictors of those who attend neither service have not been identified.METHODS: Data from Chad, Mali and Niger demographic and health surveys (DHS) were analyzed to determine risk factors for attending neither service. A conceptual framework for preventative health care-seeking behaviour was created to illustrate the hierarchical relationships between the potential risk factors. The independence of attending both ANC and EPI was investigated. A multivariate model of predictors for non-attendance was developed using logistic regression.RESULTS: ANC and EPI attendance were found to be strongly associated in all three countries. However, 47% of mothers in Chad, 12% in Mali and 36% in Niger did not attend either ANC or EPI. Region, mother's education and partner's education were predictors of non-attendance in all three countries. Wealth index, ethnicity, and occupation were associated with non-attendance in Mali and Niger. Other predictors included religion, healthcare autonomy, household size and number of children under five.CONCLUSIONS: Attendance of ANC and EPI are not independent and therefore the majority of pregnant women in these countries will have the opportunity to receive ITNs through both services. Although attendance at ANC and EPI are not independent, delivery through both systems may still add incrementally to delivery through one alone. Therefore, there is potential to increase the proportion of women and children receiving ITNs by delivering through both of these channels. However, modelling is required to determine the level of attendance and incremental potential at which it's cost effective to deliver through both services.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-2875-10-341"

A quantitative understanding of the factors that predict the distribution and timing of outbreaks will enable their prevention and facilitate the completion of global eradication.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Children with poliomyelitis in Africa from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2010 were identified through routine surveillance of cases of acute flaccid paralysis, and separate outbreaks associated with importation of wild-type poliovirus were defined using the genetic relatedness of these viruses in the VP1/2A region. Potential explanatory variables were examined for their association with the number, size, and duration of poliomyelitis outbreaks in 6-mo periods using multivariable regression analysis. The predictive ability of 6-mo-ahead forecasts of poliomyelitis outbreaks in each country based on the regression model was assessed. A total of 142 genetically distinct outbreaks of poliomyelitis were recorded in 25 African countries, resulting in 1-228 cases (median of two cases). The estimated number of people arriving from infected countries and &lt;5-y childhood mortality were independently associated with the number of outbreaks. Immunisation coverage based on the reported vaccination history of children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis was associated with the duration and size of each outbreak, as well as the number of outbreaks. Six-month-ahead forecasts of the number of outbreaks in a country or region changed over time and had a predictive ability of 82%.CONCLUSIONS: Outbreaks of poliomyelitis resulted primarily from continued transmission in Nigeria and the poor immunisation status of populations in neighbouring countries. From 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011, reduced transmission in Nigeria and increased incidence in reinfected countries in west and central Africa have changed the geographical risk of polio outbreaks, and will require careful immunisation planning to limit onward spread.

Mathematical models, and in particular network models, of disease spread are promising as tools for control-policy design, because they can provide comprehensive quantitative representations of disease transmission.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A layered dynamical network model for the transmission and control of zoonotic diseases is introduced as a tool for analyzing disease spread and designing cost-effective surveillance and control. The model development is achieved using brucellosis transmission among wildlife, cattle herds, and human sub-populations in an agricultural system as a case study. Precisely, a model that tracks infection counts in interacting animal herds of multiple species (e.g., cattle herds and groups of wildlife for brucellosis) and in human subpopulations is introduced. The model is then abstracted to a form that permits comprehensive targeted design of multiple control capabilities as well as model identification from data. Next, techniques are developed for such quantitative design of control policies (that are directed to both the animal and human populations), and for model identification from snapshot and time-course data, by drawing on recent results in the network control community.SIGNIFICANCE: The modeling approach is shown to provide quantitative insight into comprehensive control policies for zoonotic diseases, and in turn to permit policy design for mitigation of these diseases. For the brucellosis-transmission example in particular, numerous insights are obtained regarding the optimal distribution of resources among available control capabilities (e.g., vaccination, surveillance and culling, pasteurization of milk) and points in the spread network (e.g., transhumance vs. sedentary herds). In addition, a preliminary identification of the network model for brucellosis is achieved using historical data, and the robustness of the obtained model is demonstrated. As a whole, our results indicate that network modeling can aid in designing control policies for zoonotic diseases.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001259"

Several mechanisms are used to distribute ITNs, including health facility-based targeted distribution to high-risk groups; community-based mass distribution; social marketing with or without private sector subsidies; and integrating ITN delivery with other public health interventions. The objective of this analysis is to describe bednet coverage in a district in western Kenya where the primary mechanism for distribution is to pregnant women and infants who attend antenatal and immunization clinics. We use data from a population-based census to examine the extent of, and factors correlated with, ownership of bednets. We use both multivariable logistic regression and spatial techniques to explore the relationship between household bednet ownership and sociodemographic and geographic variables. We show that only 21% of households own any bednets, far lower than the national average, and that ownership is not significantly higher amongst pregnant women attending antenatal clinic. We also show that coverage is spatially heterogeneous with less than 2% of the population residing in zones with adequate coverage to experience indirect effects of ITN protection.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0025949"

The genetic diversity of organisms in the field will have implications for cross-protective capacities of any vaccine developed, and for an effective vaccine design strategy proper genotyping and understanding of existing genetic diversity in the field is necessary. We searched for variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) loci for use in a multi-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA). Sequencing analysis of 30 potential VNTRs using a panel of 17 reference strains from geographically diverse origins identified 12 VNTRs with allelic profiles differing between strains. Application of MLVA to 38 E. ruminantium-infected Amblyomma variegatum collected from indigenous cattle in 6 different districts of Uganda identified 21 MLVA types. The discriminatory power of MLVA was greater than that of map1 PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, with which only 6 genotypes were obtained. The high discriminatory power as well as cost- effective performance of MLVA provide the potential for this technique to be applied in the future with respect to optimizing vaccine trials by identifying local strain diversity, and also raise the possibility of exploring the association between E. ruminantium genotypes and phenotypes such as pathological outcome in the ruminant host.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S003118201100165X"

No information currently exists in Botswana concerning the HPV types causing precancerous or cancerous lesions. Our goal was to determine the prevalence of HPV types associated with precancerous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) stages 2 and 3 in HIV-infected women in Gaborone, Botswana. HIV-infected women referred to our clinic with high-grade intraepithelial lesion on the Pap smear were enrolled in the study. HPV typing was only performed if the histopathology results showed CIN stage 2 or 3 disease using linear array genotyping (CE-IVD, Roche Diagnostics). One hundred HIV-infected women were identified with CIN stages 2 or 3 between August 11, 2009 and September 29, 2010. Eighty-two of 100 women enrolled had coinfection by multiple HPV subtypes (range, 2 to 12). Of the remaining 18 women, 14 were infected with a single high-risk subtype and 4 had no HPV detected. Overall, 92 (92%) women were infected with at least 1 high-risk HPV subtype, and 56 were coinfected with more than 1 high-risk HPV type (range, 2 to 5). Fifty-one (51%) women had HPV subtypes 16, 18, or both. HPV 16 and 18 are the most common types in HIV-infected women with CIN 2 or 3 in Gaborone, Botswana, suggesting that the implementation of HPV vaccination programs could have a significant impact on the reduction of cervical cancer incidence. However, given the relative lack of knowledge on the natural history of cervical cancer in HIV-infected women and the significant prevalence of infection and coinfection with other high-risk HPV types in our sample, the true impact and cost-effectiveness of such vaccination programs need to be evaluated.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/PGP.0b013e31821bf2a6"

To confront malaria, the Government of Kenya has been implementing and coordinating three approaches - vector control by distributing insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spraying, case management, and the management of malaria during pregnancy. Immunization is recognized as one of the most cost-effective public health interventions. Efforts are underway to develop a malaria vaccine. The most advanced (RTS,S), is currently going through phase 3 trials. Although recent studies show the overwhelming support in the community for the introduction of a malaria vaccine, two issues - culture and the delivery of child immunization services - need to be considered. Alongside the modern methods of malaria control described above, traditional methods coexist and act as barriers to attainment of universal immunization. The gender dimension of the immunization programme (where women are the main child caretakers) will also need to be addressed. There is an age dimension to child immunization programmes. Two age cohorts of parents, caregivers, or family members deserve particular attention. These are the youth who are about to initiate childbearing, and the elderly (particularly mother-in-laws who often play a role in child-rearing). Mothers who are less privileged and socially disadvantaged need particular attention when it comes to child immunization. Access to immunization services is often characterized in some Kenyan rural communities in terms of living near the main road, or in the remote inaccessible areas. Should a malaria vaccine become available in the future, a strategy to integrate it into the immunization programme in Kenya should take into account at least two issues. First, it must address the fact that alongside the formal approach in malaria control, there exist the informal traditional practices among communities. Secondly, it must address particular issues in the delivery of immunization services.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=17496"

The primary outcome measure was incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted.RESULTS: Under the base-case assumptions (assuming 50% coverage among individuals aged ≥2 years), reactive vaccination could have averted 1 320 deaths and 23 650 DALYs. Considering herd immunity, the corresponding values would have been 2 920 deaths and 52 360 DALYs averted. The total vaccination costs would have been ~$74 million and ~$21 million, respectively, with per-dose vaccine price of US$5 and $1. The incremental costs per DALY averted of reactive vaccination were $2 770 and $370, respectively, for vaccine price set at $5 and $1. Assuming herd immunity, the corresponding cost was $980 with vaccine price of $5, and the programme was cost-saving with a vaccine price of $1. Results were most sensitive to case-fatality rate, per-dose vaccine price, and the size of the outbreak.CONCLUSIONS: Reactive vaccination has the potential to be a cost-effective measure to contain cholera outbreaks in countries at high risk.

Research has added basic understanding of what is required of a malaria vaccine, allowing selected candidates to be prioritized and some to be moved forward into clinical trials. To end the health burden of malaria, and its economic and social impact on development, the international community has now essentially committed itself to the eventual eradication of malaria. Given the current tentative advances towards elimination or eradication of malaria in many endemic areas, malaria vaccines constitute an additional and almost certainly essential component of any strategic plan to interrupt transmission of malaria.

Since 2004, vaccination against H5N1 influenza has become common in domestic poultry operations in China. Most influenza vaccines have been produced in embryonated chicken eggs. High yield is the essential feature of a good vaccine candidate virus.OBJECTIVE: Therefore, the large-scale manufacture of such a vaccine requires that the viral yield of H5N1 reassortant vaccine viruses in eggs and MDCK cells be increased.METHODS: We generated two sets of reassortant H5N1 viruses based on backbone viruses A/Chicken/F/98 (H9N2) and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) using reverse genetics. The HAs and NAs of the reassortants were derived from the three epidemic H5N1 strains found in China. We compared the replication properties of these recombinant H5N1 viruses in embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK cells after inserting either 20 or 38 amino acids into their NA stalks.RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that inserting 38 amino acids into the NA stalks can significantly increase the viral yield of H5N1 reassortant viruses in both embryonated chicken eggs and MDCK cells, while inserting only 20 amino acids into the same NA stalks does not. Hemagglutinin inhibition testing and protection assays indicated that recombinant H5N1 viruses with 38 aa inserted into their NA stalks had the same antigenicity as the viruses with wt-NA.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the generation of an H5N1 recombinant vaccine seed by the insertion of 38 aa into the NA stalk may be a suitable and more economical strategy for the increase in viral yield in both eggs and MDCK cells for the purposes of vaccine production.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)01295-3"

The infection and treatment method (ITM) was adopted by smallholder dairy farms for ECF immunisation in Hanang and Handeni districts of Tanzania. This study recorded incidence rates for ECF and other tick-borne diseases (TBDs) for ECF-immunised and non-immunised cattle between 1997 and 2000. Approximately 80% of smallholder households from both sites (n = 167) participated in this longitudinal study, with immunisations carried out at the request of the livestock owners. Efficacy of ITM for preventing ECF cases in these crossbred dairy cattle was estimated at 97.6%, while that for preventing ECF deaths was 97.9%. One percent of the cattle developed clinical ECF as a result of immunisation. Since ECF immunisation permits a reduction in acaricide use, an increase in other TBDs is a potential concern. Sixty-three percent of farmers continued to use the same acaricide after immunisation, with 80% of these reducing the frequency of applications. Overall, 78% of farmers increased the acaricide application interval after immunisation beyond that recommended by the manufacturer, resulting in annual savings in the region of USD 4.77 per animal. No statistical difference was observed between the immunised and non-immunised animals in the incidence of non-ECF TBDs. However, immunised animals that succumbed to these diseases showed fewer case fatalities. ITM would therefore appear to be a suitable method for ECF control in Tanzania's smallholder dairy sector.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s11250-011-9936-8"

After an extensive literature search, we identified and evaluated 15 cost-effectiveness studies conducted in the developing world. The results from these studies showed that rotavirus immunization is a cost-effective strategy and one of the best interventions to prevent rotavirus-related diarrheal disease. However, rotavirus vaccines are expensive and the vaccine price appears to be the most challenging and crucial factor for decision-makers regarding whether to introduce this vaccine into developing countries' immunization schedules. All the studies concluded that rotavirus immunization is cost effective but may not be affordable for the developing world at present. Developing countries will definitely rely on financial support from international organizations to introduce rotavirus vaccination. It is recommended that more research on cost-effective rotavirus immunization with updated data be conducted and new rotavirus vaccine candidates be developed at a cheaper price to speed up the introduction of rotavirus immunization to the developing world.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1586/erv.11.65"

The role of routine obstetric ultrasonography in the monitoring of pregnancy and identification of fetal malformations has partly contributed to lowering of fetal mortality rates. In Nigeria which has a high maternal and fetal mortality rate, many pregnant women do not have ante-natal care and not infrequently, women also deliver their babies at home and only bring the newborns to the clinics for immunization. Even when performed, most routine obstetric scans are not targeted towards the detection of fetal abnormalities.The aim of the present study is to evaluate the benefit of routinely performing abdominal scans on newborns with a view to detecting possible abnormalities which may have been missed ante-natally.METHODS: This was a longitudinal study of 202 consecutive, apparently normal newborns. Routine clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound scans were performed on the babies by their mother's bedside, before discharge. Neonates with abnormal initial scans had follow-up scans.RESULTS: There were 108 males and 94 females. There were 12 (5.9%) abnormal scans seen in five male and seven female neonates. Eleven of the twelve abnormalities were in the kidneys, six on the left and five on the right. Three of the four major renal anomalies- absent kidney, ectopic/pelvic kidney and two cases of severe hydronephrosis were however on the left side. There was one suprarenal abnormality on the right suspected to be a possible infected adrenal haemorrage. Nine of the abnormal cases reported for follow- up and of these, two cases had persistent severe abnormalities.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a 5.9% incidence of genito urinary anomalies on routine neonatal abdominal ultrasound in this small population. Routine obstetric USS is very useful but inadequate availability of skilled personnel and cost implications create great challenges in poor resource settings like Nigeria. However, awareness should be created so that parents who can afford such investigations can make informed decisions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2431-11-64"

We used Lives Saved Tool to estimate the number of lives saved from coverage increase of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)/indoor residual spraying (IRS). As an indicator of outcome, we also used under-five mortality rate. Global Fund investments comprised more than 70% of the Official Development Assistance (ODA) for malaria control in 34 countries. Each $1 million ODA for malaria enabled distribution of 50,478 ITNs [95%CI: 37,774-63,182] in the disbursement year. 1,000 additional ITNs distributed saved 0.625 lives [95%CI: 0.369-0.881]. Cumulatively Global Fund investments that increased ITN/IRS coverage in 2002-2008 prevented an estimated 240,000 deaths. Countries with higher malaria burden received less ODA disbursement per person-at-risk compared to lower-burden countries ($3.90 vs. $7.05). Increased ITN/IRS coverage in high-burden countries led to 3,575 lives saved per 1 million children, as compared with 914 lives in lower-burden countries. Impact of ITN/IRS coverage on under-five mortality was significant among major child health interventions such as immunisation showing that 10% increase in households with ITN/IRS would reduce 1.5 [95%CI: 0.3-2.8] child deaths per 1000 live births.CONCLUSIONS: Along with other key child survival interventions, increased ITNs/IRS coverage has significantly contributed to child mortality reduction since 2002. ITN/IRS scale-up can be more efficiently prioritized to countries where malaria is a major cause of child deaths to save greater number of lives with available resources.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0021309"

We sought to explore the potential impact of a vaccine with rapidly waning efficacy in a South African population.METHODS: We explored two strategies using a dynamic compartmental epidemic model for heterosexual transmission of HIV: [1] vaccination of a single cohort (30%, 60% or 90% of the initial population), with exponentially waning efficacy, but booster vaccinations at 5- or 2-year intervals, and [2] continuous vaccination of the unvaccinated population at the same coverage levels (30%, 60% or 90%) but with a constant efficacy vaccine of short duration. We also examined potential changes in post-vaccination condom use.RESULTS: The single cohort vaccination strategies did not have a substantial impact on HIV prevalence, although without boosters they still prevented 2-6% of the expected infections at 20 years, depending on the population coverage. The 5-year and 2-year booster strategies prevented 8-24% and 17-45% of the expected infections, respectively. Continuous vaccination to maintain population coverage levels resulted in more substantial reductions in population HIV prevalence and greater numbers of infections prevented: HIV prevalence at 20 years was reduced from 23% to 8-14% and the number of expected infections was decreased by 34-59%, depending on the population coverage level. Moderate changes in post-vaccination condom use did not substantially affect these outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: An HIV vaccine with partial efficacy and declining protection similar to the RV144 vaccine could prevent a substantial proportion of HIV infections if booster vaccinations were effective and available. Our estimates of the population impact of vaccination would be improved by further understanding of the duration of protection, the effectiveness of booster vaccination, and whether the vaccine efficacy varies between subpopulations at higher and lower risk of exposure.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)00950-9"

This article presents an innovation analysis for the nascent field of vaccinomics by describing one of the major challenges in this endeavor: the need for capacities in &quot;vaccinomics innovation systems&quot; to support the developing countries involved in the creation and testing of new vaccines. In particular, we discuss the need for understanding how institutional frameworks can enhance capacities as intrinsic to a systems approach to health technology development. We focus our attention on the global South, meaning the technically less advanced and developing nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This focus is timely and appropriate because the challenge for innovation in postgenomics medicine is markedly much greater in these regions where basic infrastructures are often underresourced and new or the anticipated institutional relationships can be fragile. Importantly, we examine the role of Product Development Partnerships (PDPs) as a 21st century organizational innovation that contributes to strengthening fragile institutions and capacity building. For vaccinomics innovation systems to stand the test of time in a context of global public health, local communities, knowledge, and cultures need to be collectively taken into account at all stages in programs for vaccinomics-guided vaccine development and delivery in the global South where the public health needs for rational vaccine development are urgent.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1089/omi.2011.0036"

It is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei and is transmitted by tsetse flies of the genus Glossina. The majority of cases are caused by T. b. gambiense, which gives rise to the chronic, anthroponotic endemic disease in Western and Central Africa. Infection with T. b. rhodesiense leads to the acute, zoonotic form of Eastern and Southern Africa. The parasites live and multiply extracellularly in the blood and tissue fluids of their human host. They have elaborated a variety of strategies for invading hosts, to escape the immune system and to take advantage of host growth factors. HAT is a challenging and deadly disease owing to its complex epidemiology and clinical presentation and, if left untreated, can result in high death rates. As one of the most neglected tropical diseases, HAT is characterized by the limited availability of safe and cost-effective control tools. No vaccine against HAT is available, and the toxicity of existing old and cumbersome drugs precludes the adoption of control strategies based on preventive chemotherapy. As a result, the keystones of interventions against sleeping sickness are active and passive case-finding for early detection of cases followed by treatment, vector control and animal reservoir management. New methods to diagnose and treat patients and to control transmission by the tsetse fly are needed to achieve the goal of global elimination of the disease.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2011.03536.x"

We used epidemiologic data from Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe to develop models of HPV-related infection and disease. For each country, we assessed HPV vaccination of girls before age 12 followed by screening with HPV DNA testing once, twice, or three times per lifetime (at ages 35, 40, 45). For women over age 30, we assessed only screening (with HPV DNA testing up to three times per lifetime or VIA at age 35). Assuming no waning immunity, mean reduction in lifetime cancer risk associated with vaccination ranged from 36 to 45%, and vaccination followed by screening once per lifetime at age 35 with HPV DNA testing ranged from 43 to 51%. For both younger and older women, the most effective screening strategy was HPV DNA testing three times per lifetime. Provided the cost per vaccinated girl was less than I$10 (I$2 per dose), vaccination had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [I$ (international dollars)/year of life saved (YLS)] less than the country-specific per capita GDP, a commonly cited heuristic for &quot;very cost-effective&quot; interventions. If the cost per vaccinated girl was between I$10 (I$2 per dose) and I$25 (I$5 per dose), vaccination followed by HPV DNA testing would save the most lives and would be considered good value for public health dollars. These results should be used to catalyze design and evaluation of HPV vaccine delivery and screening programs, and contribute to a dialogue on financing HPV vaccination in poor countries.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1002/ijc.26269"

CDC and UNAIDS organized several modeling research teams to explore the implications of the trial results and potential utility of this vaccine.METHODS: We explored the impact of a vaccine with moderate but rapidly waning protection (78%, 1.43 years) using an exponential decay function fit to trial data. We varied program coverage levels (20-80%), vaccine efficacy (30-90%), timing (single or multi-year programs), targeting (general or populations at higher risk), and background levels of all other prevention programs (constant or scaled-up). We simulated these various vaccination scenarios in two representative countries using demographic projections generated with Spectrum modeling software. We assumed the vaccine becomes available in 2020 and target coverage is achieved by 2025.RESULTS: A general vaccination strategy in South Africa covering 60% of the population, for example, would prevent 3.0 million infections between 2020 and 2030-36% of expected infections-and would be very effective, requiring only 39 vaccinations/infection averted. The same strategy in Thailand would prevent 81,000 infections-35% of expected infections-but would require 1725 vaccinations/infection averted. Targeting only populations at higher risk of exposure in Thailand would reduce total vaccinations given by more than ten-fold and would still prevent 52,000 infections-23% of expected infections-while requiring only 220 vaccinations/infection averted. Outcomes were sensitive to program coverage, vaccine efficacy and background levels of all other prevention programs.CONCLUSIONS: A vaccine with rapidly waning protection could have a substantial impact on the epidemic in South Africa and Thailand. Due to the short duration of effect, large numbers of vaccinations would be needed to maintain high population coverage levels. Further research into the immunological effects of booster vaccinations is warranted.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)00924-8"

Most cases were prevented in the first year, suggesting a rapidly waning efficacy. Here, we predict the population level impact and cost-effectiveness of practical implementation of such a vaccine in a setting of a generalised epidemic with high HIV prevalence and incidence.METHODS: We used STDSIM, an established individual-based microsimulation model, tailored to a rural South African area with a well-functioning HIV treatment and care programme. We estimated the impact of a single round of mass vaccination for everybody aged 15-49, as well as 5-year and 2-year re-vaccination strategies for young adults (aged 15-29). We calculated proportion of new infections prevented, cost-effectiveness indicators, and budget impact estimates of combined ART and vaccination programmes.RESULTS: A single round of mass vaccination with a RV144-like vaccine will have a limited impact, preventing only 9% or 5% of new infections after 10 years at 60% and 30% coverage levels, respectively. Revaccination strategies are highly cost-effective if vaccine prices can be kept below 150 US$/vaccine for 2-year revaccination strategies, and below 200 US$/vaccine for 5-year revaccination strategies. Net cost-savings through reduced need for HIV treatment and care occur when vaccine prices are kept below 75 US$/vaccine. These results are sensitive to alternative assumptions on the underlying sexual network, background prevention interventions, and individual's propensity and consistency to participate in the vaccination campaign.DISCUSSION: A modestly effective vaccine can be a cost-effective intervention in highly endemic settings. To predict the impact of vaccination strategies in other endemic situations, sufficient knowledge of the underlying sexual network, prevention and treatment interventions, and individual propensity and consistency to participate, is key. These issues are all best addressed in an individual-based microsimulation model.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)00923-6"

Sera were tested using the Vikia HBsAg kit followed by CMIA for detection of HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV. HBsAg-positive HCW were tested for HBV-DNA, anti-HDV, and, if positive for anti-HDV, HDV-RNA.RESULTS: Analysis of anti-HBc positivity indicated that 91% of HCW had been infected by HBV, regardless of vaccination history. Vikia HBsAg results were confirmed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) in all HCW and were positive in 17 HCW with virus load &gt;2000 IU/mL in 6 and HDV co-infection in 6.

However, comparison of the potential impact of single vaccination programs is challenging, primarily due to the limited number of vaccine analyses as well as their differing analytic approaches and reporting formats. The purpose of this study is to provide early insight into how the comparative impact of different new vaccines could be assessed in resource-poor settings with respect to affordability, cost-effectiveness, and distributional equity.METHODS: We compared the health, economic, and financial consequences of introducing the two vaccines in 72 GAVI-eligible countries using a number of different outcome measures to evaluate affordability, cost-effectiveness, and distributional equity. We use simple static models to standardize the analytic framework and improve comparability between the two new vaccines. These simple models were validated by leveraging previously developed, more complex models for rotavirus and human papillomavirus (HPV).RESULTS: With 70% coverage of a single-age cohort of infants and pre-adolescent girls, the lives saved with rotavirus (~274,000) and HPV vaccines (~286,000) are similar, although the timing of averted mortality differs; rotavirus-attributable deaths occur in close proximity to infection, while HPV-related cancer deaths occur largely after age 30. Deaths averted per 1000 vaccinated are 5.2 (rotavirus) and 12.6 (HPV). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were ~7.15 million (rotavirus) and ~1.30 million (HPV), reflecting the greater influence of discounting on the latter, given the lagtime between vaccination and averted cancer. In most countries (68 for rotavirus and 66 for HPV, at the cost of I$25 per vaccinated individual) the incremental cost per DALY averted was lower than each country's GDP per capita. Financial resources required for vaccination with rotavirus are higher than with HPV since both genders are vaccinated.CONCLUSIONS: While lifesaving benefits of rotavirus and HPV vaccines will be realized at different times, the number of lives saved over each target populations' lifetimes will be similar. Model-based analyses that use a standardized analytic approach and generate comparable outputs can enrich the priority-setting dialogue. Although new vaccines may be deemed cost-effective, other factors including affordability and distributional equity need to be considered in different settings. We caution that for priority setting in an individual country, more rigorous comparisons should be performed, using more comprehensive models and considering all relevant vaccines and delivery strategies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2334-11-174"

Nonetheless, the impact and desirability of conducting measles outbreak response immunization (ORI) in middle- and low-income countries has been controversial. World Health Organization guidelines published in 1999 recommended against ORI in such settings, although recently these guidelines have been reversed for countries with measles mortality reduction goals.METHODS: We searched literature published during 1995-2009 for papers reporting on measles outbreaks. Papers identified were reviewed by 2 reviewers to select those that mentioned ORI. World Bank classification of country income was used to identify reports of outbreaks in middle- and low-income countries.RESULTS: We identified a total of 485 articles, of which 461 (95%) were available. Thirty-eight of these papers reported on a total of 38 outbreaks in which ORI was used. ORI had a clear impact in 16 (42%) of these outbreaks. In the remaining outbreaks, we were unable to independently assess the impact of ORI.CONCLUSIONS: These findings generally support ORI in middle- and low-income countries.

This has led to consideration of the feasibility of measles elimination in Uganda within the context of global eradication. Before an elimination program is initiated, it is important to consider its potential economic impact, including its cost-effectiveness.METHODS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated for measles mortality reduction and measles elimination in Uganda. A dynamic age-structured compartmental model of measles transmission was used to simulate scenarios and estimate health outcomes and costs. The main outcome measures were costs, measles cases, measles deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and ICERs measured as cost per DALY averted through either the year 2030 or 2050.RESULTS: Measles elimination by 2020 averted 130,232 measles cases, 3520 measles deaths, and 106,330 DALYs through the year 2030, compared with the next best scenario (95% mortality reduction by 2015), and it was the most cost-effective strategy, with ICERs of $556 per DALY averted (2030 time horizon) and $284 per DALY averted (2050 time horizon).CONCLUSIONS: Measles elimination in Uganda, as part of a global eradication program, is projected to be highly cost-effective and should be considered among the available policy options for dealing with the disease.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=jir132"

Because SIAs are often supported with funds that have alternative uses, decision makers need to know how cost-effective they are compared with other options. This study integrated a dynamic stochastic model of measles transmission in Uganda (2010-2050) with a cost model to compare a strategy of maintaining Uganda's current (2008) levels of the first dose of routine measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) coverage at 68% with SIAs with a strategy using the same levels of MCV1 coverage without SIAs. The stochastic model was fitted with parameters drawn from district-level measles case reports from Uganda, and the cost model was fitted to administrative data from the Ugandan Expanded Program on Immunization and from the literature. A discount rate of 0.03, time horizon of 2010-2050, and a societal perspective on costs were assumed. Costs expressed in US dollars (2010) included vaccination costs, disease treatment costs including lost productivity of mothers, as well as costs of outbreaks and surveillance. The model estimated that adding on triennial SIAs that covered 95% of children aged 12-59 months to a system that achieved routine coverage rates of 68% would have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1.50 ($US 2010) per disability-adjusted life year averted. The ICER was somewhat higher if the discount rate was set at either 0 or 0.06. The addition of SIAs was found to make outbreaks less frequent and lower in magnitude. The benefit was reduced if routine coverage rates were higher. This cost-effectiveness ratio compares favorably to that of other commonly accepted public health interventions in sub-Saharan Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=jir131"

Antiviral agents active against HBV are available; treatment of HBV infection in those who need it has been shown to reduce the risk of HCC and death. It is estimated that 20-30% of persons with HBV infection could benefit from treatment. However, drugs active against HBV are not widely available or utilized in persons infected with HBV.

In view of these concerns, an informal World Health Organization consultation of experts concluded that: chronic HBV is a major public health problem in emerging nations; all HIV-infected persons should be screened for HBV infection; HIV/HBV co-infected persons should be treated with therapies active against both viruses and that reduce the risk of resistance; standards for the management of chronic HBV infection should be adapted to resource-constrained settings.

New meningococcal conjugate vaccines are relatively costly and their efficiency will depend on cost savings realized from no longer having to respond to epidemics.METHODS: We evaluated the cost and impacts to the public health system of the 2007 epidemic bacterial meningitis season in Burkina Faso through a survey at the different level of the health system. A micro-economic approach was used to evaluate direct medical and non medical costs for both the public health system and households, as well as indirect costs for households.RESULTS: The total national cost was 9.4 million US$ (0.69 US$ per capita). Health system costs were 7.1 million US$ (1.97% of annual national health spending), with 85.6% for reactive vaccination campaigns. The remaining 2.3 million US$ was borne by households of meningitis cases. The mean cost per person vaccinated was 1.45 US$; the mean cost of case management per meningitis case was 116.3 US$ when including household costs and 26.4 US$ when including only health sector costs. Meningitis epidemics disrupted all health services from national to operational levels with the main contributor being a large increase in medical consultations.CONCLUSIONS: Preventive meningococcal conjugate vaccines should contribute to more efficient use of funds dedicated to meningitis epidemics and limit the disruption of routine health services.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)00778-X"

The measles vaccine is particularly important in Niger, a country prone to measles outbreaks.METHODS: We developed a detailed discrete event simulation model of the vaccine supply chain representing every vaccine, storage location, refrigerator, freezer, and transport device (e.g., cold trucks, 4 × 4 trucks, and vaccine carriers) in the Niger Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Experiments simulated the impact of replacing the 10-dose measles vial size with 5-dose, 2-dose and 1-dose vial sizes.RESULTS: Switching from the 10-dose to the 5-dose, 2-dose and 1-dose vial sizes decreased the average availability of EPI vaccines for arriving patients from 83% to 82%, 81% and 78%, respectively for a 100% target population size. The switches also changed transport vehicle's utilization from a mean of 58% (range: 4-164%) to means of 59% (range: 4-164%), 62% (range: 4-175%), and 67% (range: 5-192%), respectively, between the regional and district stores, and from a mean of 160% (range: 83-300%) to means of 161% (range: 82-322%), 175% (range: 78-344%), and 198% (range: 88-402%), respectively, between the district to integrated health centres (IHC). The switch also changed district level storage utilization from a mean of 65% to means of 64%, 66% and 68% (range for all scenarios: 3-100%). Finally, accounting for vaccine administration, wastage, and disposal, replacing the 10-dose vial with the 5 or 1-dose vials would increase the cost per immunized patient from $0.47US to $0.71US and $1.26US, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The switch from the 10-dose measles vaccines to smaller vial sizes could overwhelm the capacities of many storage facilities and transport vehicles as well as increase the cost per vaccinated child.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-11-425"

Neisseria meningitidis group A (MenA) is responsible for major epidemics in Africa. Recently W-135 has emerged as an important pathogen. Currently, the strategy for control of such outbreaks is emergency use of meningococcal (MC) polysaccharide vaccines, but these have a limited ability to induce herd immunity and elicit an adequate immune response in infant and young children. In recent times initiatives have been taken to introduce meningococcal conjugate vaccine in these African countries. Currently there are two different types of MC conjugate vaccines at late stages of development covering serogroup A and W-135: a multivalent MC conjugate vaccine against serogroup A,C,Y and W-135; and a monovalent conjugate vaccine against serogroup A. We aimed to perform a structured assessment of these emerging meningococcal vaccines as a means of reducing global meningococcal disease burden among children under 5 years of age.METHODS: We used a modified CHNRI methodology for setting priorities in health research investments. This was done in two stages. In the first stage we systematically reviewed the literature related to emerging MC vaccines relevant to 12 criteria of interest. In Stage II, we conducted an expert opinion exercise by inviting 20 experts (leading basic scientists, international public health researchers, international policy makers and representatives of pharmaceutical companies). They answered questions from CHNRI framework and their &quot;collective optimism&quot; towards each criterion was documented on a scale from 0 to 100%.RESULTS: For MenA conjugate vaccine the experts showed very high level of optimism (~ 90% or more) for 7 out of the 12 criteria. The experts felt that the likelihood of efficacy on meningitis was very high (~ 90%). Deliverability, acceptability to health workers, end users and the effect on equity were all seen as highly likely (~ 90%). In terms of the maximum potential impact on meningitis disease burden, the median potential effectiveness of the vaccines in reduction of overall meningitis mortality was estimated to be 20%; (interquartile range 20-40% and min. 8%, max 50 %). For the multivalent meningococcal vaccines the experts had similar optimism for most of the 12 CHNRI criteria with slightly lower optimism in answerability and low development cost criteria. The main concern was expressed over the cost of product, its affordability and cost of implementation.CONCLUSIONS: With increasing recognition of the burden of meningococcal meningitis, especially during epidemics in Africa, it is vitally important that strategies are taken to reduce the morbidity and mortality attributable to this disease. Improved MC vaccines are a promising investment that could substantially contribute to reduction of child meningitis mortality world-wide.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-11-S3-S29"

Pneumococcal carriage serotype replacement has been widely reported following vaccine implementation. Use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines is being trialled in the elderly. Vaccination in west Africa against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (Men A), a new monovalent conjugate vaccine, was commenced in December 2010. New conjugate vaccines against, for example, Salmonella typhi and Streptococcus agalactiae, are being developed and tested in clinical trials.SUMMARY: Conjugate vaccines have been extensively used to immunize children, resulting in significant decreases in childhood morbidity and mortality. Since their introduction, evidence has grown that protection against disease is due to both direct and indirect protection (herd immunity). The optimization of priming and booster dose regimens in existing paediatric vaccination programmes, aiming for maximal and sustained direct and indirect protection using as few doses per child as possible, may broaden conjugate vaccine impact and augment cost-effectiveness in the future. This may be particularly important in strategies for wider global use of conjugate vaccines in children, as well as use in adults and the elderly. Challenges such as pneumococcal serotype replacement make ongoing surveillance of carriage and invasive disease crucial and will have implications for conjugate reformulation and the development of alternative vaccines. New conjugate vaccines for other pathogens currently in clinical trials have the potential to reduce invasive bacterial disease further, particularly in resource-poor settings.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283468996"

We assessed the effect of performance-based payment of health-care providers (payment for performance; P4P) on use and quality of child and maternal care services in health-care facilities in Rwanda.METHODS: 166 facilities were randomly assigned at the district level either to begin P4P funding between June, 2006, and October, 2006 (intervention group; n=80), or to continue with the traditional input-based funding until 23 months after study baseline (control group; n=86). Randomisation was done by coin toss. We surveyed facilities and 2158 households at baseline and after 23 months. The main outcome measures were prenatal care visits and institutional deliveries, quality of prenatal care, and child preventive care visits and immunisation. We isolated the incentive effect from the resource effect by increasing comparison facilities' input-based budgets by the average P4P payments made to the treatment facilities. We estimated a multivariate regression specification of the difference-in-difference model in which an individual's outcome is regressed against a dummy variable, indicating whether the facility received P4P that year, a facility-fixed effect, a year indicator, and a series of individual and household characteristics.FINDINGS: Our model estimated that facilities in the intervention group had a 23% increase in the number of institutional deliveries and increases in the number of preventive care visits by children aged 23 months or younger (56%) and aged between 24 months and 59 months (132%). No improvements were seen in the number of women completing four prenatal care visits or of children receiving full immunisation schedules. We also estimate an increase of 0·157 standard deviations (95% CI 0·026-0·289) in prenatal quality as measured by compliance with Rwandan prenatal care clinical practice guidelines.INTERPRETATION: The P4P scheme in Rwanda had the greatest effect on those services that had the highest payment rates and needed the least effort from the service provider. P4P financial performance incentives can improve both the use and quality of maternal and child health services, and could be a useful intervention to accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goals for maternal and child health.FUNDING: World Bank's Bank-Netherlands Partnership Program and Spanish Impact Evaluation Fund, the British Economic and Social Research Council, Government of Rwanda, and Global Development Network.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0140-6736(11)60177-3"

The virus spreads rapidly in unprotected populations and large scale outbreaks, such as those in South Africa in 2003 and Australia in 2007, can cost billions of pounds. Like other influenza viruses, EIV undergoes antigenic variation, enabling it to evade antibodies generated against previous infection or vaccination. The UK has an active surveillance programme to monitor antigenic drift and participates in an international collaboration with other countries in Europe, Japan and the USA to select suitable vaccine strains. Selection is primarily based upon characterisation of the viral haemagglutinin (HA), the surface protein that induces a protective antibody response; this protein is an important component of commercial vaccines. In recent years vaccine technology has improved and diagnostic methods have become increasingly sensitive, both play a crucial part in facilitating the international movement of horses. Mathematical modelling techniques have been applied to study the risk factors involved in outbreaks and provide valuable information about the impact of vaccination. Other factors, such as pathogenicity, are poorly understood for EIV yet may play an important role in the spread of a particular virus. They may also affect the ability of the virus to cross the species barrier, as seen with the transfer to dogs in the USA.

As of this writing no data are available concerning knowledge, attitudes and acceptability of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination by women in Ghana.METHODS: Between November and December 2009, a self-administered survey was used to elicit information from 264 Ghanaian women, ages 18-65.RESULTS: Overall, 40% had heard about HPV vaccine and 94% were willing to vaccinate themselves or their daughters. Ideal age for vaccination was 12.7 years. Most women (75%) thought the vaccine should be received regardless of one's number of sex partners. The most prevalent concerns were whether the vaccine would be administered safely using clean needles (82%), and possible future side effects (77%). Concerns about cost and vaccine encouraging earlier sex were reported by nearly half. Significant barriers to vaccine acceptance were women's lack of knowledge about the gravity of cervical cancer in Ghana and utility of Pap test in detecting it, low perceived risk for cervical cancer, low social support to vaccine use, and low self-efficacy to find a doctor or clinic to get vaccinated (p&lt;05). About 55% of the women did not know the vaccine only works among those who are not yet infected with HPV. Schools and television were the most preferred methods of educating the public and cervical cancer prevention ranked as the ideal message (80%). Most respondents believed the decision to vaccinate their daughter should be made by both parents (34%) or in conjunction with the daughter (37%), as opposed to the government (17%).CONCLUSIONS: Educational programs addressing specific barriers identified in the current study have the potential to significantly improve HPV vaccine uptake in Ghana.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)00486-5"

In 2008, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare planned a catch-up campaign to rapidly and equitably deliver a free long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) to every child under five years in Tanzania.METHODS: The ITN Cell, a unit within the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), coordinated the campaign on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. Government contractors trained and facilitated local government officials to supervise village-level volunteers on a registration of all U5s and the distribution and issuing of LLINs. The registration results formed the basis for the LLIN order and delivery to village level. Caregivers brought their registration coupons to village issuing posts during a three-day period where they received LLINs for their U5s. Household surveys in five districts assessed ITN ownership and use immediately after the campaign.RESULTS: Nine donors contributed to the national campaign that purchased and distributed 9.0 million LLINs at an average cost of $7.07 per LLIN, including all campaign-associated activities. The campaign covered all eight zones of mainland Tanzania, the first region being covered separately during an integrated measles immunization/malaria LLIN distribution in August 2008, and was implemented one zone at a time from March 2009 until May 2010. ITN ownership at household level increased from Tanzania's 2008 national average of 45.7% to 63.4%, with significant regional variations. ITN use among U5s increased from 28.8% to 64.1%, a 2.2-fold increase, with increases ranging from 22.1-38.3% percentage points in different regions.CONCLUSION: A national-level LLIN distribution strategy that fully engaged local government authorities helped avoid additional burden on the healthcare system. Distribution costs per net were comparable to other public health interventions. Particularly among rural residents, ITN ownership and use increased significantly for the intended beneficiaries. The upcoming universal LLIN distribution and further behaviour change communication will further improve ITN ownership and use in 2010-2011.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-2875-10-73"

In breakthrough infections, the incidence, long term prognosis and clinical significance of early infection events is not well understood but it is possible that these early events may be crucial in determining the subsequent course of disease. We use a branching process model in a deterministically varying environment to explore how the dynamics of early infection affects the accumulation of mutations which lay the seeds for long term evolution of drug resistance and immune system evasion. We relate this exploration to regimes of impact, on diversity, of tropical interventions strategies such as PrEP and vaccines. As a metric of diversity we compute the probability of existence of particular genomes which potentially arise. Using several model scenarios, we demonstrate various regimes of 'response' of evolution to 'intervention'. Transient effects of therapeutic interventions early in infection that impose a fitness cost on early viruses can significantly reduce the probability of diversity later during the chronic state of infection. This stands in contrast to the concern that early selective pressure may increase the probability of later existence of drug resistance mutations, for example. The branching process paradigm offers the ability to efficiently compute important indicators of viral diversity, in a framework with a modest number of simplifying assumptions, without simulating the full range of individual level scenarios. These models may be useful to illustrate the impact of vaccines and PrEP on viral evolution in the case of breakthrough infection. They also suggest that new measures of viral diversity which correlate to prognosis should be sought in trials for PrEP and vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0022-5193(11)00151-2"

This stakeholder analysis is part of a study to assess the sustainability of the expansion of the expanded programme of immunisation in The Gambia. This paper reports and discusses the results of the study on the dimension of attaining high levels of technical efficiency of immunization programmes. Methods: The study, was conducted on the Immunisation service of the Gambia in West Africa.METHODS: The method used was a series of in-dept interviews with sixteen key stakeholders at the central, divisional and facility levels. A stakeholder analysis tool that incorporates key indicators of financial sustainability of the EPI was used in the interviews.RESULTS: Results show that overall the majority of stakeholders strongly support the use of additional resources for implementing several actions (indicators) that can foster the financial sustainability of the EPI, including those that fall under the dimension of efficient immunisation services. Results further demonstrate that wastage is a very serious problem in the immunization system, which stakeholders generally felt is unacceptable. The causes could be grouped into four groups of factors: staff factors, resource factors, client factors and management/policy factors.CONCLUSION: Inefficiencies in the immunisation system, leading to, amomg other things, wastage of resources make expenditures in the EPI system unsustainable for a country that is experiencing slow economic growth and decreasing donor support.

The cost of treating an infection can be expensive, and no vaccine against this infection is commercially available. A genetically engineered live-attenuated strain of B. dermatitidis lacking the major virulence factor BAD-1 successfully vaccinates against lethal experimental infection in mice. Here we studied the safety, toxicity, and immunogenicity of this strain as a vaccine in dogs, using 25 beagles at a teaching laboratory and 78 foxhounds in a field trial. In the beagles, escalating doses of live vaccine ranging from 2 × 10⁴ to 2 × 10⁷ yeast cells given subcutaneously were safe and did not disseminate to the lung or induce systemic illness, but a dose of &lt; 2 × 10⁶ yeast cells induced less fever and local inflammation. A vaccine dose of 10⁵ yeast cells was also well tolerated in vaccinated foxhounds who had never had blastomycosis; however, vaccinated dogs with prior infection had more local reactions at the vaccine site. The draining lymph node cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes from vaccinated dogs demonstrated gamma interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) specifically in response to stimulation with Blastomyces antigens. Thus, the live-attenuated vaccine against blastomycosis studied here proved safe, well tolerated, and immunogenic in dogs and merits further studies of vaccine efficacy.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=CVI.00560-10"

In most countries, these low inputs, low output systems employ local breeds making use of the feeding resources available in the household. However, their replacement with introduced exotic breeds with higher productivities represents a risk for their conservation. Here, we present a simulation model to evaluate the impact of community-based interventions aiming to improve the profitability of local chicken breeds and promote their use and conservation. The results indicate that under the current conditions, farmers producing exotic chicken are able to sell more animals in a one year period; however the market price of local chicken makes their production more profitable. Vaccination campaigns significantly reduce the mortality rate of both breeds, having a positive effect on producers' income but its impact on animal off-take is larger for exotic breeds, and the availability of feeding resources is the limiting factor as the flock size increases. The results of the intervention are positive in terms of increasing farmers' income but do not clearly contribute to the conservation of indigenous breeds since after the vaccination campaign, the gap between the profitability of indigenous and exotic breeds is reduced. The simulation model indicates that under the current conditions, the conservation of indigenous chicken breeds in Benin is maintained by the existence of distinct niche markets with consumers able to pay higher prices for indigenous chicken. Policies for the conservation of chicken genetic resources in Benin are discussed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s11250-011-9790-8"

This can result in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) in subsequent D-positive pregnancies. The aim of this study is to highlight the challenges associated with the effective management and prevention of Rh alloimmunization among Rh-negative women in Sub-Saharan Africa. In most Sub-Saharan African countries, there is poor and sometimes no alloimmunization prevention following potentially sensitizing events and during medical termination of pregnancy in Rh-negative women. Information about previous pregnancies and termination are often lacking in patients' medical notes due to poor data management. These issues have made the management of Rh-negative pregnancy a huge challenge. Despite the fact that the prevalence of Rh-negative phenotype is significantly lower among Africans than Caucasians, Rh alloimmunization remains a major factor responsible for perinatal morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa and may result in the compromise of the woman's obstetric care due to the unaffordability of anti-D immunoglobulin. There is the urgent need for the implementation of universal access to anti-D immunoglobulin for the Rh-negative pregnant population in Africa. Anti-D immunoglobulin should be available in cases of potentially sensitizing events such as amniocentesis, cordocentesis, antepartum hemorrhage, vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, external cephalic version, abdominal trauma, intrauterine death and stillbirth, in utero therapeutic interventions, miscarriage, and therapeutic termination of pregnancy. There is also the need for the availability of FMH measurements following potentially sensitizing events. The low-cost acid elution method, a modification of the Kleihauer-Betke (KB) test, can become a readily available, affordable, and minimum alternative to flow cytometric measurement of FMH. Knowledge of anti-D prophylaxis among obstetricians, biomedical scientist, midwives, traditional birth attendants, pharmacists, and nurses in Africa needs to be improved. This will facilitate quality antenatal and postnatal care offered to Rh-negative pregnant population and improve perinatal outcomes.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.2147/IJWH.S15165"

However, vaccine development is complex and costly. We aimed to assess the potential cost effectiveness of novel vaccines for TB control in a sub-Saharan African country--Zambia--relative to the existing strategy of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) and current level of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination coverage.METHODS: We conducted a decision analysis model-based simulation from the societal perspective, with a 3% discount rate and all costs expressed in 2007 US dollars. Health outcomes and costs were projected over a 30-year period, for persons born in Zambia (population 11,478,000 in 2005) in year 1. Initial development costs for single vaccination and prime-boost strategies were prorated to the Zambian share (0.398%) of global BCG vaccine coverage for newborns. Main outcome measures were TB-related morbidity, mortality, and costs over a range of potential scenarios for vaccine efficacy.RESULTS: Relative to the status quo strategy, a BCG replacement vaccine administered at birth, with 70% efficacy in preventing rapid progression to TB disease after initial infection, is estimated to avert 932 TB cases and 422 TB-related deaths (prevention of 199 cases/100,000 vaccinated, and 90 deaths/100,000 vaccinated). This would result in estimated net savings of $3.6 million over 30 years for 468,073 Zambians born in year 1 of the simulation. The addition of a booster at age 10 results in estimated savings of $5.6 million compared to the status quo, averting 1,863 TB cases and 1,011 TB-related deaths (prevention of 398 cases/100,000 vaccinated, and of 216 deaths/100,000 vaccinated). With vaccination at birth alone, net savings would be realized within 1 year, whereas the prime-boost strategy would require an additional 5 years to realize savings, reflecting a greater initial development cost.CONCLUSIONS: Investment in an improved TB vaccine is predicted to result in considerable cost savings, as well as a reduction in TB morbidity and TB-related mortality, when added to existing control strategies. For a vaccine with waning efficacy, a prime-boost strategy is more cost-effective in the long term.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-11-55"

Household income was distributed as follows: low income for 18.6%, average income for 47.2%, and high income for 34.3% of the families interviewed. The average number of children under the age of 15 in a household was 3 (±2). Among children aged 0 to 11 months, the EPI antigens had the highest vaccination coverage rates, and these rates were higher in the private sector (more than 80% to 99% for some). Overall, the BCG scar was seen in 98.5% of all children; in the private sector 90.2% had received the third dose of the DTC/VPO-IPV vaccine, and in the public sector, 74.5%. The measles vaccination rate in the private sector was 82.5% compared with 64.4% in the public sector. The rates of coverage for antigens not included in the EPI varied from 50.8% to 74.2% in the private sector and from 6.2% to 32.5% in the public sector. The vaccine with the least coverage was the pneumococcal: only 3.2% and were vaccinated against this in the private sector and 0.8% in the public sector. The principal reasons for non-immunization were lack of financial resources (n = 283, 28.3%), in particular, for booster up vaccines and those recommended by the EPI, lack of information (n = 259, 25.9%), forgetfulness (n = 217, 21.7%), neglect (n = 113, 11.3%), sick child (n = 80, 8%), vaccine not available (n = 19, 1.9%), wrong information (n = 15, 1.5%), travel (n = 14, 1.4%), mother sick (n = 12, 1.2%) and lack of time (n = 18, 1.8%). Finally, the direct cost of good vaccination coverage for boosters was 42,245 FCFA (74 euros) in the public sector and 54,800 FCFA (84 euros) in the private sector.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=san.2010.0204"

Considerable efforts were undertaken to ensure adequate participation of research groups from disease-endemic countries, in particular from Africa, with the long-term aim to strengthen cooperative links and research capacities in these countries. The concept of organizing European research through major strategic projects to form a &quot;European Research Area&quot; (ERA) was originally developed in the preparation of FP6, and ERA formation has now turned into a major EU policy objective explicitly inscribed into the Lisbon Treaty. EU-funded malaria research may serve as a showcase to demonstrate how ERA formation can successfully be implemented in a given area of science when several surrounding parameters converge to support implementation of this strategic concept: timely coincidence of political stimuli, responsive programming, a clearly defined--and well confined--area of research, and the readiness of the targeted research community who is well familiar with transnational cooperation at EU level. Major EU-funded malaria projects have evolved into thematic and organizational platforms that can collaborate with other global players. Europe may thus contribute more, and better, to addressing the global research agenda for malaria.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-2875-10-11"

Objectives were to estimate the burden of RVGE among children less than five years old in the Middle East (Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, UAE, Yemen), North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia) and Turkey.METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in major databases on the epidemiology and burden of rotavirus among children less than five years old between 1999 and 2009. Data from each country was extracted and compared.RESULTS: The search identified 43 studies. RVGE was identified in 16-61% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis, with a peak in the winter. RVGE-related hospitalization rates ranged from 14% to 45%, compared to 14%-28% for non-RVGE. Annually, RVGE caused up to 112 fatalities per 100,000 in certain countries in the region. Hospitalization costs ranged from $1.8 to $4.6 million annually, depending on the country. The most recent literature available showed that G1P[8] was the most prevalent genotype combination in 8 countries (range 23%-56%). G2P[4] was most prevalent in 4 countries (26%-48%). G9P[8] and G4P[8] were also frequently detected.CONCLUSIONS: RVGE is a common disease associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic burden. Given the variety and diverse rotavirus types in the region, use of a vaccine with broad and consistent serotype coverage would be important to help decrease the burden of RVGE in the Middle East and North Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2334-11-9"

A significant proportion of the Egyptian commercial poultry system consists of small-scale poultry producers operating with low to minimal biosecurity measures. An investigation was conducted into the level of adoption of standard biosecurity measures of the small-scale commercial chicken growers, including both farm- and home-based commercial production, input suppliers and other actors along the meat chicken value chain in Fayoum, Egypt. The study which used direct observations and group discussions of nearly 160 participants and structured interviews with 463 respondents, assessed biosecurity implementation to improve management practices and ultimately to control and prevent highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The survey found that overall, biosecurity measures are rarely implemented in small-scale commercial poultry production units. Compliance with recommended biosecurity practices did not greatly vary from home-based to farm-based commercial production. Furthermore, serious risk practices were identified, such as unsafe disposal of poultry carcasses and potential disease spread posed by poor biosecurity measures implemented during vaccination. HPAI control measures have been ineffective due to limited cooperation between public and private sector, aggravated by the unpopular measures taken in the event of outbreaks and no compensation paid for incurred losses. Outreach and biosecurity awareness raising initiatives should be specifically developed for small-scale producers with the objective of improving general poultry management and thus preventing HPAI and other poultry diseases.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0167-5877(12)00391-1"

A questionnaire was used to collect data on use of the priority public health services by all individuals in the households (n=22,169). The level of use was disaggregated by socio-economic status (SES), rural-urban location and gender. Benefits were valued using the cost of providing the service. Net benefit incidence was calculated by subtracting payments made for services from the value of benefits.RESULTS: The results showed that 3,281 (14.8%) individuals consumed wholly free services. There was a greater consumption of most free services by rural dwellers, females and those from poorer SES quintiles (but not for insecticide-treated nets and ante-natal care services). High levels of payment were observed for immunisation services, insecticide-treated nets, anti-malarial medicines, antenatal care and childbirth services, all of which are supposed to be provided for free. The net benefits were significantly higher for the rural residents, males and the poor compared to the urban residents, females and better-off quintiles.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that coverage of all of these priority public health services fell well below target levels, but the poorer quintiles and rural residents that are in greater need received more benefits, although not so for females. Payments for services that are supposed to be delivered free of charge suggests that there may have been illegal payments which probably hindered access to the public health services.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-9276-11-70"

Since vaccination at levels short of those necessary to achieve eradication may increase the average age of infection, and thus potentially the CRS burden, introduction of the vaccine has been limited to contexts where coverage is high. Recent work suggests that spatial heterogeneity in coverage should also be a focus of concern. Here, we use a detailed dataset from South Africa to explore the implications of heterogeneous vaccination for the burden of CRS, introducing realistic vaccination scenarios based on reported levels of measles vaccine coverage. Our results highlight the potential impact of country-wide reductions of incidence of rubella on the local CRS burdens in districts with small population sizes. However, simulations indicate that if rubella vaccination is introduced with coverage reflecting current estimates for measles coverage in South Africa, the burden of CRS is likely to be reduced overall over a 30 year time horizon by a factor of 3, despite the fact that this coverage is lower than the traditional 80 per cent rule of thumb for vaccine introduction, probably owing to a combination of relatively low birth and transmission rates. We conclude by discussing the likely impact of private-sector vaccination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=rsif.2012.0756"

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) offers a new opportunity to control this disease. This study aimed to estimate the costs of a school-based HPV vaccination project in three districts in Mwanza Region (NCT ID: NCT01173900), Tanzania and to model incremental scaled-up costs of a regional vaccination program.METHODS: We first conducted a top-down cost analysis of the vaccination project, comparing observed costs of age-based (girls born in 1998) and class-based (class 6) vaccine delivery in a total of 134 primary schools. Based on the observed project costs, we then modeled incremental costs of a scaled-up vaccination program for Mwanza Region from the perspective of the Tanzanian government, assuming that HPV vaccines would be delivered through the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI).RESULTS: Total economic project costs for delivering 3 doses of HPV vaccine to 4,211 girls were estimated at about US$349,400 (including a vaccine price of US$5 per dose). Costs per fully-immunized girl were lower for class-based delivery than for age-based delivery. Incremental economic scaled-up costs for class-based vaccination of 50,290 girls in Mwanza Region were estimated at US$1.3 million. Economic scaled-up costs per fully-immunized girl were US$26.41, including HPV vaccine at US$5 per dose. Excluding vaccine costs, vaccine could be delivered at an incremental economic cost of US$3.09 per dose and US$9.76 per fully-immunized girl. Financial scaled-up costs, excluding costs of the vaccine and salaries of existing staff were estimated at US$1.73 per dose.CONCLUSIONS: Project costs of class-based vaccination were found to be below those of age-based vaccination because of more eligible girls being identified and higher vaccine uptake. We estimate that vaccine can be delivered at costs that would make HPV vaccination a very cost-effective intervention. Potentially, integrating HPV vaccine delivery with cost-effective school-based health interventions and a reduction of vaccine price below US$5 per dose would further reduce the costs per fully HPV-immunized girl.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1741-7015-10-137"

The PfSPZ Vaccine comprises whole live-attenuated cryopreserved sporozoites stored in liquid nitrogen (LN(2)) vapor phase (LNVP) below -140°C and would be distributed through a LNVP cold chain. The purpose of this study was to model LNVP cold chain distribution for the cryopreserved PfSPZ Vaccine in Tanzania, estimate the costs and compare these costs to those that would be incurred in distributing a 'conventional' malaria vaccine through the EPI. Capital and recurrent costs for storage, transportation, labor, energy usage and facilities were determined for the birth cohort in Tanzania over five years. Costs were calculated using WHO/UNESCO calculators. These were applied to a 2-8°C distribution model with national, regional, district, and health facility levels, and for the cryopreserved vaccine using a 'modified hub-and-spoke' (MH-S) LNVP distribution system comprising a central national store, peripheral health facilities and an intermediate district-level transhipment stop. Estimated costs per fully immunized child (FIC) were $ 6.11 for the LNVP-distributed cryopreserved vaccine where the LN(2) is generated, and $ 6.04 with purchased LN(2) (assuming US $ 1.00/L). The FIC costs for distributing a conventional vaccine using the four level 2-8°C cold chain were $ 6.10, and with a tariff distribution system as occurs in Tanzania the FIC cost was $ 5.53. The models, therefore, predicted little difference in 5-year distribution costs between the PfSPZ Vaccine distributed through a MH-S LNVP cold chain and a conventional vaccine distributed through the more traditional EPI system. A LNVP cold chain provides additional benefits through the use of durable dry shippers because no refrigerators, freezers or refrigerated trucks are required. Thus strain at the cold chain periphery, vaccine wastage from cold chain failures and the environmental impact of distribution would all be reduced.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)01584-8"

Tanzania is presented as a case study where the WHO C4P tool was used to cost and plan the roll-out of HPV vaccines nationwide as part of the national comprehensive cervical cancer prevention and control strategy.METHODS: The WHO C4P tool focuses on estimating the incremental costs to the health system of vaccinating adolescent girls through school-, health facility- and/or outreach-based strategies. No costs to the user (school girls, parents or caregivers) are included. Both financial (or costs to the Ministry of Health) and economic costs are estimated. The cost components for service delivery include training, vaccination (health personnel time and transport, stationery for tally sheets and vaccination cards, and so on), social mobilization/IEC (information, education and communication), supervision, and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). The costs of all the resources used for HPV vaccination are totaled and shown with and without the estimated cost of the vaccine. The total cost is also divided by the number of doses administered and number of fully immunized girls (FIGs) to estimate the cost per dose and cost per FIG.RESULTS: Over five years (2011 to 2015), the cost of establishing an HPV vaccine program that delivers three doses of vaccine to girls at schools via phased national introduction (three regions in year 1, ten regions in year 2 and all 26 regions in years 3 to 5) in Tanzania is estimated to be US$9.2 million (excluding vaccine costs) and US$31.5 million (with vaccine) assuming a vaccine price of US$5 (GAVI 2011, formerly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations). This is equivalent to a financial cost of US$5.77 per FIG, excluding the vaccine cost. The most important costs of service delivery are social mobilization/IEC and service delivery operational costs.CONCLUSIONS: When countries expand their immunization schedules with new vaccines such as the HPV vaccine, they face initial costs to fund critical pre-introduction activities, as well as incremental system costs to deliver the vaccines on an ongoing basis. In anticipation, governments need to plan ahead for non-vaccine costs so they will be financed adequately. Existing human resources need to be re-allocated or new staff need to be recruited for the program to be implemented successfully in a sustainable and long-term manner.Reaching a target group not routinely served by national immunization programs previously with three doses of vaccine requires new delivery strategies, more transport of vaccines and health workers and more intensive IEC activities leading to new delivery costs for the immunization program that are greater than the costs incurred when a new infant vaccine is added to the existing infant immunization schedule. The WHO C4P tool is intended to help LMICs to plan ahead and estimate the programmatic and operational costs of HPV vaccination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1741-7015-10-136"

Our objective was to quantify the range of additional benefits conferred by second-generation HPV prophylactic vaccines that are expected to expand protection to five additional oncogenic types (31, 33, 45, 52 and 58).METHODS: A microsimulation model of HPV and cervical cancer calibrated to epidemiological data from two countries (Kenya and Uganda) was used to estimate reductions in lifetime risk of cervical cancer from the second-generation HPV vaccines. We explored the independent and joint impact of uncertain factors (i.e., distribution of HPV types, co-infection with multiple HPV types, and unidentifiable HPV types in cancer) and vaccine properties (i.e., cross-protection against non-targeted HPV types), compared against currently-available vaccines.RESULTS: Assuming complete uptake of the second-generation vaccine, reductions in lifetime cancer risk were 86.3% in Kenya and 91.8% in Uganda, representing an absolute increase in cervical cancer reduction of 26.1% in Kenya and 17.9% in Uganda, compared with complete uptake of current vaccines. The range of added benefits was 19.6% to 29.1% in Kenya and 14.0% to 19.5% in Uganda, depending on assumptions of cancers attributable to multiple HPV infections and unidentifiable HPV types. These effects were blunted in both countries when assuming vaccine cross-protection with both the current and second-generation vaccines.CONCLUSION: Second-generation HPV vaccines that protect against additional oncogenic HPV types have the potential to improve cervical cancer prevention. Co-infection with multiple HPV infections and unidentifiable HPV types can influence vaccine effectiveness, but the magnitude of effect may be moderated by vaccine cross-protective effects. These benefits must be weighed against the cost of the vaccines in future analyses.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0048426"

Poor country governments often lack the resources to provide optimal access to preventive services and a great deal of attention is being directed towards the private sector to fill this void. In many developing countries, the private sector already plays a large role in health care. However, the for-profit private sector has little incentive to provide PHSs. The lack of provision of services by the for-profit sector may create a barrier to take-up of these services. In this study, we use data from a census of health facilities combined with data from community and provider surveys from Kenya to analyse whether the private for-profit sector has lower provision rates of child immunization services, and subsequently whether this creates a barrier that results in lower immunization take-up. We show that only 34% of for-profit facilities provide immunizations and that in areas with a larger share of for-profit providers, children are more likely to have no immunization coverage. Our model predicts that the odds of a child receiving no immunization coverage are 4.8 times higher in areas where all health facilities are for-profit compared to areas with no for-profit facilities. This indicates that a policy of engagement with the private for-profit sector aimed at increasing provision of immunization services may be an effective strategy for increasing take-up.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23144204"

Cumulated over the first five years of life vaccination was predicted to prevent 34% of the outpatient visits, 31% of the hospitalizations and 42% of the deaths. The estimated prevented costs accumulated over five years totalled US$1,782,761 (direct and indirect costs) with an associated 48,585 DALYs. From a societal perspective Rotarix had a cost-effectiveness ratio of US$142 per DALY (US$5 for the full course of two doses) and RotaTeq US$288 per DALY ($10.5 for the full course of three doses).

Of the two vaccines Rotarix was the preferred choice due to a better cost-effectiveness ratio, the presence of a vaccine vial monitor, the requirement of fewer doses and less storage space, and proven thermo-stability.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0047511"

Such findings require replication from trials specifically designed to assess the impact of nutritional intervention during pregnancy on infant immune development. The current trial seeks to establish: (a) which combination of protein-energy (PE) and multiple-micronutrient (MMN) supplements would be most effective; and (b) the most critical periods for intervention in pregnancy and infancy, for optimal immune development in infancy.DESIGN: The ENID Trial is a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial randomized, partially blind trial to assess whether nutritional supplementation to pregnant women (from &lt; 20 weeks gestation to term) and their infants (from 6 to 12 months of age) can enhance infant immune development. Eligible pregnant women from the West Kiang region of The Gambia (pregnancy dated by ultrasound examination) are randomized on entry to 4 intervention groups (Iron-folate (FeFol = standard care), multiple micronutrients (MMN), protein-energy (PE), PE + MMN). Women are visited at home weekly for supplement administration and morbidity assessment and seen at MRC Keneba at 20 and 30 weeks gestation for a detailed antenatal examination, including ultrasound. At delivery, cord blood and placental samples are collected, with detailed infant anthropometry collected within 72 hours. Infants are visited weekly thereafter for a morbidity questionnaire. From 6 to 12 months of age, infants are further randomized to a lipid-based nutritional supplement, with or without additional MMN. The primary outcome measures of this study are thymic development during infancy, and antibody response to vaccination. Measures of cellular markers of immunity will be made in a selected sub-cohort. Subsidiary studies to the main trial will additionally assess the impact of supplementation on infant growth and development to 24 months of age.DISCUSSION: The proposed trial is designed to test whether nutritional repletion can enhance early immune development and, if so, to help determine the most efficacious form of nutritional support. Where there is evidence of benefit from a specific intervention/combination of interventions, future research should focus on refining the supplements to achieve the optimal, most cost-effective balance of interventions for improved health outcomes.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2393-12-107"

Dukoral, a killed whole-cell two-dose OCV, was used in a mass vaccination campaign in 2009 in Zanzibar. Public and private costs of illness (COI) due to endemic cholera and costs of the mass vaccination campaign were estimated to assess the cost-effectiveness of OCV for this particular campaign from both the health care provider and the societal perspective.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Public and private COI were obtained from interviews with local experts, with patients from three outbreaks and from reports and record review. Cost data for the vaccination campaign were collected based on actual expenditure and planned budget data. A static cohort of 50,000 individuals was examined, including herd protection. Primary outcome measures were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per death, per case and per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses were conducted. The ICER was evaluated with regard to WHO criteria for cost-effectiveness. Base-case ICERs were USD 750,000 per death averted, USD 6,000 per case averted and USD 30,000 per DALY averted, without differences between the health care provider and the societal perspective. Threshold analyses using Shanchol and assuming high incidence and case-fatality rate indicated that the purchase price per course would have to be as low as USD 1.2 to render the mass vaccination campaign cost-effective from a health care provider perspective (societal perspective: USD 1.3).SIGNIFICANCE: Based on empirical and site-specific cost and effectiveness data from Zanzibar, the 2009 mass vaccination campaign was cost-ineffective mainly due to the relatively high OCV purchase price and a relatively low incidence. However, mass vaccination campaigns in Zanzibar to control endemic cholera may meet criteria for cost-effectiveness under certain circumstances, especially in high-incidence areas and at OCV prices below USD 1.3.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001844"

The extent to which pharmacoeconomic analysis is employed in the same role in low-income countries is less well established. This systematic review identifies and briefly describes pharmacoeconomic studies which have been conducted in Tanzania and further assesses their influence in the selection of essential medicines.METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Cinahl and Cochrane databases were searched using &quot;economic evaluation&quot;, &quot;cost-effectiveness analysis&quot;, &quot;cost-benefit analysis&quot; AND &quot;Tanzania&quot; as search terms. We also scanned reference lists and searched in Google to identify other relevant articles. Only articles reporting full economic evaluations about drug therapies and vaccines conducted in Tanzania were included. The national essential medicine list and other relevant policy documents related to the identified articles were screened for information regarding the use of economic evaluation as a criterion for medicine selection.RESULTS: Twelve pharmacoeconomic studies which met our inclusion criteria were identified. Seven studies were on HIV/AIDS, malaria and diarrhoea, the three highest ranked diseases on the disease burden in Tanzania. Six studies were on preventive and treatment interventions targeting pregnant women and children under the age of five years. The national essential medicine list and the other identified policy documents do not state the use of economic evaluation as one of the criteria which has influenced the listing of the drugs.CONCLUSION: Country specific pharmacoeconomic analyses are too scarce and inconsistently used to have had a significant influence on the selection of essential medicines in Tanzania. More studies are required to fill the existing gap and to explore whether decision-makers have the ability to interpret and utilise pharmacoeconomic evidence. Relevant health authorities in Tanzania should also consider how to apply pharmacoeconomic analyses more consistently in the future priority-setting decisions for selection of essential medicines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1472-6947-12-110"

We explore the benefits and cost-effectiveness of individual and integrated packages of interventions to prevent pregnancy-related deaths.METHODS: We adapt a previously validated maternal mortality model to Nigeria. Model outcomes included clinical events, population measures, costs, and cost-effectiveness ratios. Separate models were adapted to Southwest and Northeast zones using survey-based data. Strategies consisted of improving coverage of effective interventions, and could include improved logistics.RESULTS: Increasing family planning was the most effective individual intervention to reduce pregnancy-related mortality, was cost saving in the Southwest zone and cost-effective elsewhere, and prevented nearly 1 in 5 abortion-related deaths. However, with a singular focus on family planning and safe abortion, mortality reduction would plateau below MDG 5. Strategies that could prevent 4 out of 5 maternal deaths included an integrated and stepwise approach that includes increased skilled deliveries, facility births, access to antenatal/postpartum care, improved recognition of referral need, transport, and availability quality of EmOC in addition to family planning and safe abortion. The economic benefits of these strategies ranged from being cost-saving to having incremental cost-effectiveness ratios less than $500 per YLS, well below Nigeria's per capita GDP.CONCLUSIONS: Early intensive efforts to improve family planning and control of fertility choices, accompanied by a stepwise effort to scale-up capacity for integrated maternal health services over several years, will save lives and provide equal or greater value than many public health interventions we consider among the most cost-effective (e.g., childhood immunization).","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-12-786"

The objective of this study was to understand the incidence of sharps injury and occupational BBF exposure of mucous membranes involving medical waste handlers (MWHs). A cross-sectional study was carried out using a self-administered questionnaire, observation and interview. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.

One or more incidents of sharps injuries and BBF exposures to mucous membranes occurred among 42.1% and 67.5% of MWHs respectively. None of the respondents was immunized with hepatitis B vaccine owing to the high cost of immunization and absence of free universal availability of the vaccine for the adult population. Less than 50% of MWHs wore either gloves or boots while performing their activities. Even though all knew about HIV, most of the respondents demonstrated a lack of knowledge regarding viral hepatitis. The risk of sharps injury and BBF exposure appeared high in MWHs. The establishment of safe waste-management techniques and the appropriate use of personnel protective equipment among MWHs in Addis Ababa is urgently required.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=0734242X12459550"

The major factors associated with epidemiology of ECF include the agro-ecological zone (AEZ), livestock production system (LPS) and both animal breed and age. These factors appear to influence the epidemiology of ECF through structured gradients. We further show that the gradients are dynamically shaped by socio-demographic and environmental processes. For a vector-borne disease whose transmission depends on environmental characteristics that influence vector dynamics, a change in the environment implies a change in the epidemiology of the disease. The review recommends that future ECF epidemiological studies should account for these factors and the dynamic interactions between them. In Kenya, ECF control has previously relied predominantly on tick control using acaricides and chemotherapy while ECF immunization is steadily being disseminated. We highlight the contribution of ECF epidemiology and economics in the design of production system and/or geographical area-specific integrated control strategies based on both the dynamic epidemiological risk of the disease and economic impacts of control strategies. In all production systems (except marginal areas), economic analyses demonstrate that integrated control in which ECF immunization is always an important component, can play an important role in the overall control of the disease. Indeed, Kenya has recently approved ECF immunization in all production systems (except in marginal areas). If the infrastructure of the vaccine production and distribution can be heightened, large ECF endemic areas are expected to be endemically stable and the disease controlled. Finally, the review points the way for future research by identifying scenario analyses as a critical methodology on which to base future investigations on how both dynamic livestock management systems and patterns of land use influence the dynamics and complexity of ECF epidemiology and the implications for control.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1756-3305-5-194"

In Uganda, FMD outbreaks are mainly controlled by ring vaccination and restriction of animal movements. Vaccination stimulates immunity and prevents animals from developing clinical signs which include lameness, inappetence, and decreased production. Ring vaccination and restriction of animal movements have, however, not successfully controlled FMD in Uganda and outbreaks reoccur annually. The objective of this study was to review the use of FMD virus (FMDV) vaccines and assess the effectiveness of vaccination programs for controlling FMD in Uganda (2001-2010), using retrospective data. FMD vaccine distribution patterns in Uganda (2001-2010) matched occurrence of outbreaks with districts reporting the highest number of outbreaks also receiving the largest quantity of vaccines. This was possibly due to &quot;fire brigade&quot; response of vaccinating animals after outbreaks have been reported. On average, only 10.3 % of cattle within districts that reported outbreaks during the study period were vaccinated. The average minimum time between onset of outbreaks and vaccination was 7.5 weeks, while the annual cost of FMDV vaccines used ranged from US $58,000 to 1,088,820. Between 2001 and 2010, serotyping of FMD virus was done in only 9/121 FMD outbreaks, and there is no evidence that vaccine matching or vaccine potency tests have been done in Uganda. The probability of FMDV vaccine and outbreak mismatch, the delayed response to outbreaks through vaccination, and the high costs associated with importation of FMDV vaccines could be reduced if virus serotyping and subtyping as well as vaccine matching were regularly done, and the results were considered for vaccine manufacture.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s11250-012-0254-6"

The early appearance and subsequent long-term persistence of antibodies combined with cost-effectiveness make antibody detection techniques essential in control programmes. Recent reports appear to indicate that the serological tests recommended by the OIE for ASF monitoring are much less effective in East and Southern Africa where viral genetic and antigenic diversity is the greatest. We report herein an extensive analysis including more than 1000 field and experimental infection sera, in which the OIE recommended tests are compared with antigen-specific ELISAs and immuno-peroxidase staining of cells (IPT). The antibody detection results generated using new antigen-specific tests, developed in this study, which are based on production of antigen fractions generated by infection and virus purification from COS-1 cells, showed strong concordance with the OIE tests. We therefore conclude that the lack of success is not attributable to antigenic polymorphism and may be related to the specific characteristics of the local breeds African pigs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0378-1135(12)00462-2"

South Africa has played a leadership role in the African continent with introduction of new vaccines, which dates back to 1995 with the introduction of hepatitis B, followed by the Haemophilus influenzae type b in 1999 and recently the national roll out of the pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines in 2009. NAGI has the responsibility to deliberate on key policy issues as part of the process for decision making on the introduction of new vaccines. In developing recommendations NAGI considers: disease burden, cost effectiveness, and the impact on the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). Although guidance and recommendations from WHO are considered, the decision to introduce a new vaccine in South Africa is based on local data. NAGI recommendations are presented to the National Department of Health (NDOH). The NDOH pursues the matter further through the involvement of provinces. When an agreement has been reached to accept the NAGI recommendations, the NDOH seeks funding from the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Once funds are available, the new vaccines are implemented by the immunisation programme. Although there is an established functional system for decision making in South Africa, some areas need to be addressed. A system should be developed to allow the NDOH, NAGI and the MOF to engage in the deliberations on financial and economic impact of new vaccines. It is further recommended that a committee be established that will assess the programmatic issues to weigh the potential benefits of a new vaccine. Furthermore, political commitment should support the immunisation programme and strengthen it so that it can make an impact in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal no. 4 of reducing child mortality.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)00549-X"

National vaccination policy is determined by the Department of Health, based on advice from a national advisory group on immunisation. Standard health economic criteria of effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, affordability and burden of disease are used to assess whether new vaccinations should be introduced. Global guidelines and the advice of local and international experts are also helpful in making the determination to introduce new vaccines. In terms of recent decisions to introduce new vaccines against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus diarrhoea in children, the evidence has proved unequivocal. Universal rollout has been implemented even though this has led to a fivefold increase in national spending on vaccines. The total cost to government remains below 1-1.5% of public expenditures for health, which is viewed by the South African authorities as affordable and necessary given the number of lives saved and morbidity averted. To manage the rapid increase in domestic spending, efforts have been made to scale up coverage over several years, give greater attention to negotiating price reductions and, in some cases, obtain initial donations or frontloaded deliveries to facilitate earlier universal rollout.

This article discusses some of the claims made by South African anti-vaccination groups, including some drawn from anti-vaccination lobbyists based in highly resourced countries. While research is underway to better understand the scope and influence of anti-vaccine groups, it is important to build capacity among healthcare workers within the Expanded Programme on Immunisation of South Africa to enable them to deal empathically and effectively with parents and caregivers who have been exposed to anti-vaccination messages and who question the need to vaccinate their children. Claims that vaccines cause adverse effects need to be supported by valid and reliable scientific evidence. However, evidence alone that vaccines are safe and effective does not always result in parents being convinced to vaccinate their children. In addition to providing important evidence of vaccine safety, this paper discusses the important role of communication - especially dialogue - in building public trust in vaccination with the ultimate goal of increasing vaccination coverage and preventing future outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)00413-6"

This impacts on patient/parent compliance and creates a challenge for health care providers for implementation of schedules necessitating training and infrastructure improvements. Use of combination rather than component vaccines offers advantages for compliance by single dose administration of various antigens, reducing stock costing as well as reducing cost of additional health care visits. Combination vaccines are often significantly more expensive than individual constituent vaccines. Concerns regarding an increased incidence of adverse events with use of combination vaccines have not been confirmed and rates may seem high as the adverse events seem to mimic the sum total of adverse event rates for each individual antigen used but may in fact be lower. Manufacturers typically advise against interchanging use of vaccine products. Despite this, health authorities advocate use of an alternative vaccine where the original vaccine in not available, to ensure continuity of vaccination. A notable exception is the acellular pertussis vaccine. Partly, because no serological correlates of immunity exist, but also a general lack of convincing follow up studies has prompted the recommendation for manufacturer fidelity for at least the first 3 vaccine doses. According to the South African Medicines Formulary, a variety of vaccines are available in South Africa. Although a large number are available in the private sector, the only true combination vaccine included in the current state EPI, modified in 2009, is the DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccine (Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis, inactivated Poliomyelitis virus and Haemophilus influenzae type b). There are many reasons justifying the use of combination vaccines rather that the individual constituent formulations. Implementation of use in the South African setting at this point is still limited, but may offer an exciting avenue of expanding the antigen repertoire without impacting on side-effects, efficacy or complexity of scheduling.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)00674-3"

The decision to incorporate IPV into the routine schedule was not based on cost-effectiveness, which it is not. Other factors were taken into account: Firstly, the sequence benefits from the initial mucosal contact with live(vaccine) virus which promotes the IgA response from subsequent IPV, as well as herd immunity from OPV, together with the safety of IPV. Secondly, given the widespread and increasing use of IPV in the developed world, public acceptance of vaccination in general is enhanced in South Africa which is classified as an upper middle income developing country.

However, based on current trends that show that many developing countries will not reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targets, there is an urgent need to accelerate efforts to control the most common conditions still responsible for the largest morbidity and mortality in children under 5 years of age, like diarrhoea and pneumonia, for which safe and effective vaccines are now available. Through World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) strategies and initiatives like the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS), Accelerated Disease Control and Reach Every District (RED), major positive achievements like the increasing number of children reached with Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP) vaccines, significant measles mortality reduction, and the almost complete eradication of polio, have been realised. Many children in developing countries have access to life saving vaccines through the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) support. Supplementary immunization activities against measles and polio continue to offer opportunities to deliver measles and polio vaccines, and other life-saving interventions. The Global Immunization Vision and Strategy 2006-2015 (GIVS framework) can effectively be used to guide countries in addressing some of the remaining challenges to reach the unreached and increase coverage of traditional vaccines, immunize more people against more diseases, support decision making to introduce new vaccines, as well as recognize the opportunity to invest in community health through cost-effective immunization programmes. Introduction of new vaccines should be strengthened and used as vehicles for health systems strengthening as well as for delivery of comprehensive primary health interventions to impact positively on the spiralling disease burden and reduce overall child mortality. A number of countries have adopted and operationalized GIVS through comprehensive multi-year plans for immunization (cMYP). This paper reviews progress with respect to introduction of some of the new vaccines in the East and Southern sub-region of WHO African region in the context of GIVS and MDGs as well as the challenges thereof.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)00838-9"

This review summarizes studies on pneumococcal epidemiology and PCV undertaken in South Africa, which contributed to the process of advocating for the inclusion of PCV into the public immunization program. Surveillance prior to the introduction of 7-valent PCV (PCV-7) indicated that 70% (418/593) of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in infants, the age-group at highest risk of IPD, was attributable to PCV-7 serotypes. Furthermore, 65% of all IPD in children under-5 years was associated with underlying HIV infection. Initial immunogenicity studies reported that PCV vaccination of antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected children was associated with lower geometric mean antibody concentrations and proportion with a serotype-specific antibody concentration above the putative threshold (≥0.35 μg/ml) of protection for IPD for some of the serotypes. The functionality of antibody induced by PCV in HIV-infected infants was inferior to that of HIV-uninfected infants. Vaccine efficacy of 9-valent PCV in a trial from South Africa reported an 83% reduction of vaccine-serotype IPD in HIV-uninfected children in the first two years of life, with protection persisting thereafter. However, vaccine efficacy against vaccine-serotype IPD declined from 65% at 2.3 years of age to 39% by six years of age in antiretroviral-naïve HIV-infected children. Based on the observation that a two-dose primary series of PCV during infancy resulted in similar immunogenicity compared to a three-dose schedule, as well as similar impact on nasopharyngeal colonization and effectiveness against IPD in HIV-uninfected children, the South African immunization program adopted a two-dose primary series with a booster dose at 9 months of age. This schedule was largely premised on containing the cost of vaccine introduction, whilst including a booster dose of PCV to assist in prolonging the duration of protection in HIV-infected children.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)00795-5"

Recently, formative research conducted in the U.S. and developing countries like South Africa have sought to gain a better understanding of the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about cervical cancer prevention, HPV, and the acceptance of the HPV vaccine. This study compares findings from two independent focus group studies. One study was conducted in a segregated township in Johannesburg, South Africa (n = 24) and the other study was conducted in Ohio Appalachia (n = 19). The following seven themes emerged during the discussions from both studies: HPV and cervical cancer; health decision making; parent-child communication; healthy children; HPV vaccine costs; sexual abuse; and HPV vaccine education. Findings from both studies indicate the importance of the role of mothers and grandmothers in the health care decision-making process for children and a lack of awareness of HPV and its association with cervical cancer. While there was interest in the HPV vaccine, participants voiced concern about the vaccine's cost and side effects. Some participants expressed concern that receipt of the HPV vaccine may initiate adolescent sexual behavior. However, other participants suggested that the HPV vaccine may protect young women who may experience sexual abuse. The importance of developing culturally appropriate educational materials and programs about cervical cancer prevention and the HPV vaccine were expressed by participants in both countries.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s10995-012-1116-6"

Results demonstrate high mobile phone access but limited use of phones to access SRH information and services. Barriers to use of these services include cost of service for young female clients, request for socio-demographic information that could break anonymity, poor marketing and publicity, socio-cultural beliefs and expectations of young girls, individual personality and beliefs, as well as infrastructural/network quality. It is therefore recommended that these barriers be adequately addressed to increase the potential use of mobile phone for providing adolescent and young girls with SRH information and services.

The WHO has recommended the birth dose to prevent perinatal transmission of HBV. A Markov model was constructed to analyse the costs and effects associated with avoiding perinatal transmission of HBV through a birth dose vaccination in addition to the existing vaccination schedule in Mozambique. The comparator intervention is the existing vaccination schedule administered at 6-10-14 weeks. The analysis was conducted for the birth cohort of 2008. As the context is a low-income setting our main outcome measure was disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Transition probabilities, costs and effects were estimated based on a thorough literature review. One- to three-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for uncertainty in the data. We found an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the additional birth dose of 250.95 US$ per DALY averted. Assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of 441 US$, which was the GDP per capita for Mozambique in 2008, the findings show the additional birth dose to be highly cost-effective. However, one-way sensitivity analysis reveals that the outcome changes with parameter variation. To give unambiguous recommendations on introducing the birth dose in Mozambique, more information on the parameters that render the birth dose cost-ineffective in sensitivity analysis is needed. Those parameters are 'vaccine effectiveness', 'prevalence of HBV among mothers', 'the transition probability from chronic HBV to liver cancer' and 'the risk of perinatal transmission for mothers negative for the Hepatitis B &quot;e&quot; antigen (HBeAg)'. Parameter variation (one-way) showed the ICER to lie between 72 US$/DALY averted and 683 US$/DALY averted.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)01173-5"

Before licensure both vaccines were extensively tested for safety (for intussusception) and efficacy in trials comprising in over 60,000 infants each. Rotarix is a single-strain human rotavirus vaccine (RV1) and RotaTeq is a combination of five bovine-human reassortant rotaviruses (RV5). Although the composition of the two vaccines is different, their field effectiveness and, largely, mechanism of action are similar. Both prevent effectively severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) but are less efficacious against mild RVGE or rotavirus infection. Field effectiveness of these vaccines in Europe and the USA against severe RVGE has been above 90% and in Latin America around 80%. Trials in Africa have yielded efficacy rates between 50 and 80%. Rotavirus vaccination has been introduced into the national immunization programmes of about 20 countries in Latin America, with Brazil and Mexico as leading countries, as well as in the USA, Australia and South Africa. Introduction into other African countries will start in 2012. In Europe, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria and Finland and five federal states of Germany have introduced universal rotavirus vaccination. The reasons for the slow progress in Europe include low mortality from RVGE, unfavourable cost-benefit calculations in some countries, and concerns that still exist over intussusception.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2012.03981.x"

We assessed challenges and enablers for the programme in South Africa, as we approach the 2015 deadline for the Millennium Development Goals.METHODS: Between September 2009 and September 2010 we requested national and provincial EPI managers in South Africa to identify key challenges facing EPI, and to propose appropriate solutions. We collated their responses and searched for systematic reviews on the effectiveness of the proposed solutions; in the Health Systems Evidence, Cochrane Library, and PubMed electronic databases. We screened the search outputs, selected systematic reviews, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included reviews (using AMSTAR) and the quality of the evidence (using GRADE) in duplicate; resolving disagreements by discussion and consensus.RESULTS: Challenges identified by EPI managers were linked to healthcare workers (insufficient knowledge of vaccines and immunisation), the public (anti-immunisation rumours and reluctance from parents), and health system (insufficient financial and human resources). Strategies proposed by managers to overcome the challenges include training, supervision, and audit and feedback; strengthening advocacy and social mobilisation; and sustainable EPI funding schemes, respectively. The findings from reliable systematic reviews indicate that interactive educational meetings, audit and feedback, and supportive supervision improve healthcare worker performance. Structured and interactive communication tools probably increase parents' understanding of immunisation; and reminders and recall, use of community health workers, conditional cash transfers, and mass media interventions probably increase immunisation coverage. Finally, a national social health insurance scheme is a potential EPI financing mechanism; however, given the absence of high-quality evidence of effects, its implementation should be pilot-tested and the impacts and costs rigorously monitored.CONCLUSION: In line with the Millennium Development Goals, we have to ensure that our children's right to health, development and survival is respected, protected and promoted. EPI is central to this vision. We found numerous promising strategies for improving EPI performance in South Africa. However, their implementation would need to be tailored to local circumstances and accompanied by high-quality monitoring and evaluation. The strength of our approach comes from having a strong framework for interventions before looking for systematic reviews. Without a framework, we would have been driven by what reviews have been done and what is easily researchable; rather than the values and preferences of key immunisation stakeholders.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-12-578"

While several efforts at reducing the burden of fevers have been made at the macro level, the relationship between socioeconomic status and fever prevalence has been inconclusive at the household and individual levels. The purpose of this study was to examine how individual and household socioeconomic status influences the prevalence of fever among children under age five in four sub-Saharan African countries.METHODS: The study used data from the 2008 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) from Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya and Sierra Leone with a total of 38,990 children below age five. A multi-level random effects logistic model was fitted to examine the socioeconomic factors that influence the prevalence of fever in the two weeks preceding the survey. Data from the four countries were also combined to estimate this relationship, after country-specific analysis.RESULTS: The results show that children from wealthier households reported lower prevalence of fever in Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya. Result from the combined dataset shows that children from wealthier households were less likely to report fever. In general, vaccination against fever-related diseases and the use of improved toilet facility reduces fever prevalence. The use of bed nets by children and mothers did not show consistent relationship across the countries.CONCLUSION: Poverty does not only influence prevalence of fever at the macro level as shown in other studies but also the individual and household levels. Policies directed towards preventing childhood fevers should take a close account of issues of poverty alleviation. There is also the need to ensure that prevention and treatment mechanisms directed towards fever related diseases (such as malaria, pneumonia, measles, diarrhoea, polio, tuberculosis etc.) are accessible and effectively used.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1756-0500-5-380"

We describe operational lessons learnt from a phase IV poliomyelitis vaccine trial in a semi-rural region of South Africa.METHODS: We reviewed operational data collected over the duration of the trial with respect to staff recruitment and training, participant recruitment and retention, and cold chain maintenance. RESULTS-LESSONS LEARNT: The recruitment model we used that relied on the 24h physical presence of a team member in the birthing unit was expensive and challenging to manage. Forecasting of enrolment rates was complicated by incomplete baseline data and by the linear nature of forecasts that do not take into account changing variables. We found that analyzing key operational data to monitor progress of the trial enabled us to identify problem areas timeously, and to facilitate a collegial problem-solving process by the extended trial team. Pro-actively nurturing a working relationship with the public sector health care system and the community was critical to our success. Despite the wide geographical area and lack of fixed addresses, we maintained an excellent retention rate through community assistance and the use of descriptive residential information. Training needs of team members were ongoing and dynamic and we discovered that these needs that were best met by an in-house, targeted and systemized training programme. The use of vaccine refrigerators instead of standard frost-free refrigerators is cost-effective and necessary to maintain the cold-chain.CONCLUSION: Operational challenges of a vaccine trial in developing world populations include inexperienced staff, the close liaison required between researchers and public health care services, impoverished participants that require complex recruitment and retention strategies, and challenges of distance and access. These challenges can be overcome by innovative strategies that allow for the unique characteristics of the setting, trial population, and trial team.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)01028-6"

The incidence of injuries to travelers caused by potentially rabid animals is approximately 0.4% per month of stay. Dogs account for 51% of cases, and the remaining animals, notably monkeys, carry a lower risk of rabies transmission. Travel to Southeast Asia, India, and north Africa, young age, and traveling for tourism are risk factors for potential exposure; the duration of travel is not a risk factor. More than 70% of travelers are not immunized prior to departing and do not receive adequate care when injured.SUMMARY: The intradermal vaccination route has been proven economical, safe, and immunogenic in the population of rabies-endemic areas, and this route of administration has been recently used in travelers from developed countries. The immunity provided by the three-dose series is long-lasting and should be considered an investment for future travel.

Consequently, Tanzania is striving to scale-up safe medical male circumcision to reduce HIV transmission. However, there is a need to investigate the perceptions of male circumcision in Tanzania using specific populations. The purpose of the present study was to assess the perceptions of male circumcision in a cohort of police officers that also served as a source of volunteers for a phase I/II HIV vaccine (HIVIS-03) trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.METHODS: In-depth interviews with 24 men and 10 women were conducted. Content analysis informed by the socio-ecological model was used to analyze the data.RESULTS: Informants perceived male circumcision as a health-promoting practice that may prevent HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections. They reported male circumcision promotes sexual pleasure, confidence and hygiene or sexual cleanliness. They added that it is a religious ritual and a cultural practice that enhances the recognition of manhood in the community. However, informants were concerned about the cost involved in male circumcision and cleanliness of instruments used in medical and traditional male circumcision. They also expressed confusion about the shame of undergoing circumcision at an advanced age and pain that could emanate after circumcision. The participants advocated for health policies that promote medical male circumcision at childhood, specifically along with the vaccination program.CONCLUSIONS: The perceived benefit of male circumcision as a preventive strategy to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is important. However, there is a need to ensure that male circumcision is conducted under hygienic conditions. Integrating male circumcision service in the routine childhood vaccination program may increase its coverage at early childhood. The findings from this investigation provide contextual understanding that may assist in scaling-up male circumcision in Tanzania.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-12-529"

The assumption was that increased childhood survival in vaccinated cohorts leads to increased numbers of children consuming government resource, and an increased number of future tax payers.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the difference in lifetime discounted net tax revenue generated by RV vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts from the Egyptian government perspective.METHODS: The model framework adopts the Egyptian government perspective for RV immunization costs (year 2009 values) and all government transfers (e.g. education costs, health costs, pensions). To reflect the government tax revenue, we applied a fixed income tax burden to earnings over the lifetime of vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. At each year of the model, we derive net taxes (gross taxes less transfers) discounted to the immunization year to reflect the present value of RV vaccination investment costs.RESULTS: Projected incremental net present values of the vaccinated cohort versus the unvaccinated cohort are $US6.1 million, $US58.1 million and $US55.7 million at 25-, 50- and 72-year time horizons, respectively. The internal rate of return for the government based on RV vaccination at years 25, 50 and 72 was 10.8%, 15.1% and 14.9, respectively. Within the first 5 years of vaccination, 76% of vaccine acquisition costs were offset due to direct and indirect cost savings attributed to a reduction in RV-related disease burden. Investments in RV vaccination in a single year are entirely offset when the vaccinated cohort of newborns reach 22 years of age.CONCLUSION: The government perspective is useful for evaluating investments in RV vaccination because of ongoing government transfers and tax receipts attributed to changes in RV-attributed morbidity and mortality. The analysis described here illustrates that investing in RV offers tangible long-term fiscal benefits for government over many generations that would not ordinarily be captured in economic evaluations typically applied to healthcare interventions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=5"

At the same time, HIV aid may have positively affected some maternal health services, such as prenatal blood testing.

Today, PEPFAR continues to expand its HIV prevention, treatment, and care activities while also supporting capacity-building initiatives, coordination efforts, and implementation science. The latter is research focused on improving service delivery, maximizing cost-effectiveness, and achieving public health impact. Recent advances in both scientific knowledge and the provision of prevention, treatment, and care services have bred cautious optimism about greatly reducing the spread of HIV.

For the purpose of development and access by the relevant population groups, it is crucial that these microbicides be produced at low cost. For the promising protein and peptide candidate molecules, it appears that current production systems are overburdened and expensive to establish and maintain. With recent developments in vector systems for protein expression coupled with downstream protein purification technologies, plants are rapidly gaining credibility as alternative production systems.

In case of severe exposure, the first dose of vaccine is combined with passive transfer of a rabies virus-specific immunoglobulin preparation. Preventative vaccination for rabies, also referred as pre-exposure vaccination, is reserved for humans at high risk. Although available vaccines are efficacious in preventing disease, rabies still claims the lives of an estimated 55,000 humans residing in Africa and Asia each year. Half of the death occurs in children under the age of 15.AREAS COVERED: This paper discusses whether preventative vaccination of all children in Africa and Asia, which was deemed non-cost-effective compared to post-exposure vaccination using currently licensed vaccines in Thailand, could be cost-effective using more immunogenic novel vaccines.EXPERT OPINION: At least in theory, novel one-dose rabies vaccines may be cost-effective for preventative childhood immunization, which in turn should reduce the incidence of this disease. Further clinical testing of such vaccines with the goal to develop a low-cost vaccine that can be incorporated into childhood immunization programs for areas with a high incidence of rabies-related death should be strongly encouraged.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1517/14712598.2012.691162"

However, progress has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the components of a protective immune response and limited animal models, rendering the field unable to reliably predict vaccine efficacy earlier in preclinical development, including by evaluation in animal models, and limiting the predictive utility of comparing immunogenic effects across vaccine candidates in phase I/II studies. Consequently, new candidate vaccines have to be evaluated for efficacy in large-scale phase II/III trials using clinical endpoints. Apart from the technical challenges of characterising TB incidence in target populations at high risk of acquiring TB disease and standardising case definitions in order to improve both the sensitivity and more importantly the specificity of trial endpoints, there is an urgency in expanding and supporting the considerable trial infrastructure that will be required to evaluate and ultimately license a new TB vaccine. In the longer term, implementation strategies are dependent on what policy makers most value. Economic analyses will be essential to guide policy and implementation. This paper outlines the gaps and challenges and identifies solutions for effectively developing and efficiently introducing a new TB vaccine.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S1472-9792(12)00080-7"

Between 2000 and 2007, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative sponsored 19 Phase 1 or 2A preventive HIV vaccine trials in the US, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and India, enrolling 900 healthy HIV-1 uninfected volunteers.OBJECTIVE: To assess background morbidity as reflected by unsolicited adverse events (AEs), unrelated to study vaccine, reported in clinical trials from four continents.METHODS: All but three clinical trials were double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled. Study procedures and data collection methods were standardized. The frequency and severity of AEs reported during the first year of the trials were analyzed. To avoid confounding by vaccine-related events, solicited reactogenicity and other AEs occurring within 28 d after any vaccination were excluded.RESULTS: In total, 2134 AEs were reported by 76% of all participants; 73% of all events were mild. The rate of AEs did not differ between placebo and vaccine recipients. Overall, the percentage of participants with any AE was higher in Africa (83%) compared with Europe (71%), US (74%) and India (65%), while the percentage of participants with AEs of moderate or greater severity was similar in all regions except India. In all regions, the most frequently reported AEs were infectious diseases, followed by gastrointestinal disorders.CONCLUSIONS: Despite some regional differences, in these healthy participants selected for low risk of HIV infection, background morbidity posed no obstacle to clinical trial conduct and interpretation.

This study investigated the risks to healthcare workers in Zambia.DESIGN: A survey was completed anonymously by a convenience sample of workers in three hospitals and two clinics in Zambia. Respondents provided information regarding job category, injuries with contaminated sharps, hepatitis B vaccination status and the availability of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).RESULTS: Nurses reported the largest number of injuries. The average annual sharps injury rate was 1.3 injuries per worker, and service workers (housekeepers, laundry, ward assistants) had the highest rate of these injuries, 1.9 per year. Injuries were often related to inadequate disposal methods. Syringe needles accounted for the largest proportion of injuries (60%), and 15% of these injuries were related to procedures with a higher-than-average risk for infection. Most workers (88%) reported the availability of PEP, and only 8% were fully vaccinated against hepatitis B.CONCLUSIONS: The injury risks identified among Zambian workers are serious and are exacerbated by the high prevalence of bloodborne pathogens in the population. This suggests that there is a high risk of occupationally acquired bloodborne pathogen infection. The findings also highlight the need for a hepatitis B vaccination program focused on healthcare workers. The risks associated with bloodborne pathogens threaten to further diminish an already scarce resource in Zambia - trained healthcare workers. To decrease these risks, we suggest the use of low-cost disposal alternatives, the implementation of cost-sensitive protective strategies and the re-allocation of some treatment resources to primary prevention.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S1876-0341(12)00031-7"

The community emerged as an important motivating factor in terms of altruism, a sense of duty to the community and gaining community respect and pride. This was enhanced by community selection of the volunteers. Major challenges included incorrect community perceptions of CBSVs, problems with transportation and equipment, difficulties conducting both volunteer and farm work and late or lack of payment for ad hoc tasks such as National Immunization Days. Most CBSVs recognized that they were volunteers, understood the constraints of the health system and were not demanding remuneration. However, CBSVs strongly desired something tangible to show that their work is recognized and appreciated and described a number of low cost items that could be used.

The major constraints to village chicken production were mortality (95 % of the households) followed by feed shortage (85 %) and low chicken sales (72 %). The logistic regression model showed that households that owned imported/crossbred chickens practiced extensive production system without housing structures and did not have vaccines were more likely to experience high levels of chicken mortality. Poor and youth-headed households with no supplements and vaccines had high probability of Newcastle disease. The probability of a household to experience chicken feed shortage was lower in households that owned indigenous chickens than those that owned imported/crossbred chickens (odds ratio, 11.68; 95 % confidence interval, 1.19-27.44). Youth-headed households that had small flocks and no access to veterinary services were not likely to sell chickens.

Numerous studies document the relationship between vaccination coverage and access, socio economic and demographic factors. However, there is less knowledge about the relationship between vaccination coverage and carers' motivation and willingness to seek childhood vaccinations. The aim of this paper is to introduce a framework for studying demand for childhood vaccination and to examine the coherence between theoretical predictions and empirical findings in a rural area in Malawi. We interviewed 635 carers with children aged 18-59 months. About 96 percent of the respondents reported to have fully vaccinated their youngest eligible child for all routine vaccinations scheduled in the Expanded Program on Immunization. This paper concludes that easy access to vaccination services cannot explain why demand is high. Many carers had to travel long distances to reach vaccination delivery points and a considerable share of the respondents scored waiting and travelling time as long. Results from the present study, in combination with theoretical predictions, suggest that a high level of trust in distributors of information and vaccines may be an essential explanatory factor for why carers seek immunization for their children, even in the presence of considerable costs.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe and frequently lethal protozoan disease of increasing incidence and severity due to infected human and dog migration, new geographical distribution of the insect due to global warming, coinfection with immunosuppressive diseases, and poverty. The disease is an anthroponosis in India and Central Africa and a canid zoonosis (ZVL) in the Americas, the Middle East, Central Asia, China, and the Mediterranean. The ZVL epidemic has been controlled by one or more measures including the culling of infected dogs, treatment of human cases, and insecticidal treatment of homes and dogs. However, the use of vaccines is considered the most cost-effective control tool for human and canine disease. Since the severity of the disease is related to the generation of T-cell immunosuppression, effective vaccines should be capable of sustaining or enhancing the T-cell immunity. In this review we summarize the clinical and parasitological characteristics of ZVL with special focus on the cellular and humoral canine immune response and review state-of-the-art vaccine development against human and canine VL. Experimental vaccination against leishmaniasis has evolved from the practice of leishmanization with living parasites to vaccination with crude lysates, native parasite extracts to recombinant and DNA vaccination. Although more than 30 defined vaccines have been studied in laboratory models no human formulation has been licensed so far; however three second-generation canine vaccines have already been registered. As expected for a zoonotic disease, the recent preventive vaccination of dogs in Brazil has led to a reduction in the incidence of canine and human disease. The recent identification of several Leishmania proteins with T-cell epitopes anticipates development of a multiprotein vaccine that will be capable of protecting both humans and dogs against VL.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.3389/fimmu.2012.00069"

This qualitative study aimed to explore processes of national decision-making around new vaccine adoption and to understand the factors affecting these decisions. Ninety-five key informant interviews were conducted in seven low- and middle-income countries: Bangladesh, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kenya, Mali and South Africa. Framework analysis was used to explore issues both within and between countries. The underlying driver for adoption decisions in GAVI-eligible countries was the desire to seize GAVI windows of opportunity for funding. By contrast, in South Africa and Guatemala, non-GAVI-eligible countries, the decision-making process was more rooted in internal and political dynamics. Decisions to adopt new vaccines are, by nature, political. The main drivers influencing decisions were the availability of funding, political prioritization of vaccination or the vaccine-preventable disease and the burden of disease. Other factors, such as financial sustainability and feasibility of introduction, were not as influential. Although GAVI procedures have established more formality in decision-making, they did not always result in consideration of all relevant factors. As familiarity with GAVI procedures increased, questioning by decision-makers about whether a country should apply for funding appeared to have diminished. This is one of the first studies to empirically investigate national processes of new vaccine adoption decision-making using rigorous methods. Our findings show that previous decision-making frameworks (developed to guide or study national decision-making) bore little resemblance to real-life decisions, which were dominated by domestic politics. Understanding the realities of vaccine policy decision-making is critical for developing strategies to encourage improved evidence-informed decision-making about new vaccine adoptions.

However, differences exist in areas of accessibility to child healthcare, parental attitude towards immunisation and efficiency of the child healthcare system. The aim of this paper is, to share with the medical community, the similarities and differences in child healthcare between the two countries. This would be of interest to colleagues who have not worked in both systems.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22519167"

The GPEI built on many lessons learned from smallpox eradication, including the large-scale deployment of technical assistance, implementing agendas of innovation and research and the use of professionally planned and guided advocacy. By the year 2000, the incidence of polio globally had decreased by 99% compared with the estimated &gt;350,000 cases reported from 125 endemic countries in 1988. By 2002, three WHO Regions (the Americas, Western Pacific and European Regions) had been certified polio-free. By 2005, transmission of indigenous wild poliovirus (WPV) had been interrupted in all but 4 'endemic' countries: India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where eradication efforts effectively stalled. WPV exported from northern Nigeria and northern India subsequently caused &gt;50 outbreaks and paralysed &gt;1500 children in previously polio-free countries across Asia and Africa. In each of the four remaining polio-endemic countries different challenges, or a combination of factors, prevented to build up sufficient levels of population immunity to stop transmission. Consequently, specific strategies were increasingly tailored to each setting. A new 2010-2012 GPEI Strategic Plan was developed which brought together several approaches to overcome the remaining hurdles to eradication, including the large-scale use of bivalent oral poliovaccine (bOPV) in supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). By the end of 2010, the impact of the new GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-2012 was apparent. Compared to 2009, the number of new polio cases in 2010 fell by 95% in both northern Nigeria and northern India, the world's largest remaining reservoirs of indigenous WPVs. By mid-2011, India had not reported a polio case for more than 5 months, and in Nigeria, endemic transmission appeared to be restricted to the north-east and north-west corners of the country. While polio cases due to WPV type 3 were still being detected in west and central Africa, the overall level of WPV3 transmission globally was at an all-time low. Uncontrolled WPV transmission appeared to be restricted to Chad and Pakistan, which increasingly represented the greatest risks to the GPEI. Although insufficient financing continued to be a major concern, political support for completing polio eradication in polio-infected countries was stronger than ever by mid-2011. While continued transmission in some areas, particularly in Pakistan and Chad, still had to be controlled as a matter of urgency, there were real opportunities to achieve new landmarks in polio eradication, especially in the key WPV reservoirs of India and Nigeria, setting the stage for polio to soon follow smallpox into the history books.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(11)01599-4"

Equity-focused approaches have the potential to accelerate the progress towards achieving the health-related MDGs faster than the current pace in a more cost-effective and sustainable manner. Ghana's rate of progress towards MDGs 4 and 5 related to reducing child and maternal mortality respectively is less than what is required to achieve the targets. The objective of this paper is to examine the equity dimension of child and maternal health outcomes and interventions using Ghana as a case study.METHODS: Data from Ghana Demographic and Health Survey 2008 report is analyzed for inequities in selected maternal and child health outcomes and interventions using population-weighted, regression-based measures: slope index of inequality and relative index of inequality.RESULTS: No statistically significant inequities are observed in infant and under-five mortality, perinatal mortality, wasting and acute respiratory infection in children. However, stunting, underweight in under-five children, anaemia in children and women, childhood diarrhoea and underweight in women (BMI &lt; 18.5) show inequities that are to the disadvantage of the poorest. The rates significantly decrease among the wealthiest quintile as compared to the poorest. In contrast, overweight (BMI 25-29.9) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30) among women reveals a different trend - there are inequities in favour of the poorest. In other words, in Ghana overweight and obesity increase significantly among women in the wealthiest quintile compared to the poorest. With respect to interventions: treatment of diarrhoea in children, receiving all basic vaccines among children and sleeping under ITN (children and pregnant women) have no wealth-related gradient. Skilled care at birth, deliveries in a health facility (both public and private), caesarean section, use of modern contraceptives and intermittent preventive treatment for malaria during pregnancy all indicate gradients that are in favour of the wealthiest. The poorest use less of these interventions. Not unexpectedly, there is more use of home delivery among women of the poorest quintile.CONCLUSION: Significant Inequities are observed in many of the selected child and maternal health outcomes and interventions. Failure to address these inequities vigorously is likely to lead to non-achievement of the MDG targets related to improving child and maternal health (MDGs 4 and 5). The government should therefore give due attention to tackling inequities in health outcomes and use of interventions by implementing equity-enhancing measure both within and outside the health sector in line with the principles of Primary Health Care and the recommendations of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-12-252"

Inconsistency in standards, particularly within a research network highlights the need to balance volunteers' health and wellness with the efficient conduct of research. Ten research centers (RC's) in East and Southern Africa affiliated with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) were studied using a mixed methods approach to understand variations, similarities and gaps in services provided, recipients of services, referral systems, and barriers to referral uptake. These data were then used to develop expected standards across the 10 RCs. Findings indicated that RCs consistently provided HIV risk reduction and family planning (FP) counseling, male condoms, management of sexually transmitted infections, CD-4 counts, and general medical care to volunteers and non-research volunteers. Services that were less consistently provided on-site included: female condoms, adult male circumcision (AMC), antiretroviral therapy (ART) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in case of rape. The FP options provided on-site varied, with few providing implants, intrauterine devices, tubal ligation, and vasectomy. Most RCs had established referral systems for ART, AMC, PEP, and FP, but few had referral points for psychosocial services. Few RCs had comprehensive guidelines on referrals other than those related to adverse events. Findings indicate that the greatest challenges for referral uptake were transportation and health care costs, poor quality and inconsistency of services at some referral points. Few RCs covered the cost of referrals for non-study related adverse events. A collaborative process between IAVI and the RCs was undertaken to reach consensus on expected standards of care. A set of required and recommended services to be provided on-site or by referral was developed. In developing such standards, we tried to balance scientific priorities, equity, contextual realities, community expectations, and cost-effectiveness.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1080/09540121.2012.656572"

The diversity of risk in populations needs to be factored into clinical development plans, specific but feasible clinical endpoints need to be agreed upon, and TB vaccines need to be effective in both uninfected and infected populations. An achievable efficacy target needs to be set while standardisation of trial outcomes and critical choices based on the vaccine development pipeline need to be made. Alternative routes of vaccine administration should be thoroughly explored, sufficient adequately prepared trial sites for performing TB vaccine assessments are required and creative use of study designs should be used to expedite progress towards licensure while at the same time containing costs.

Causes of death ascertained through these methods are known to be grossly inaccurate. Most data from Africa on mortality and causes of death currently used by international agencies have come from verbal autopsy studies, which only provide inaccurate estimates of causes of death. Autopsy rates in most sub-Saharan African countries have declined over the years, and actual causes of deaths in the community and in hospitals in most sub-Saharan African countries remain unknown. The quality of cause-specific mortality statistics remains poor. The effect of various interventions to reduce mortality rates can only be evaluated accurately if cause-specific mortality data are available. Autopsy studies could have particular relevance to direct public health interventions, such as vaccination programs or preventive therapy, and could also allow for study of background levels of subclinical tuberculosis disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-HIV coinfection, and other infectious and noncommunicable diseases not yet clinically manifest. Autopsies performed soon after death may represent a unique opportunity to understand the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis and the pathogenesis of early deaths after initiation of antiretroviral therapy. The few autopsies performed so far for research purposes have yielded invaluable information and insights into tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other opportunistic infections. Accurate cause-specific mortality data are essential for prioritization of governmental and donor investments into health services to reduce morbidity and mortality from deadly infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. There is an urgent need for reviving routine and research autopsies in sub-Saharan African countries.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=jir859"

Supporting NUHDSS data were used to determine whether any trend in maternal health care was coincident with immunizations, a non-voucher outpatient service. As part of NUHDSS, households in Korogocho and Viwandani reported place of delivery and the presence of a skilled birth attendant (2003-10) and vaccination coverage (2003-09). A detailed maternal and child health (MCH) tool was added to NUHDSS (September 2006-10). Prospective enrolment in NUHDSS-MCH was conditional on having a newborn after September 2006. In addition to recording mother's place of delivery, NUHDSS-MCH recorded the use of the voucher.FINDINGS: There were significantly greater odds of a facility-based delivery among respondents during the voucher programme compared with similar respondents prior to voucher launch. Testing whether unrelated outpatient care also increased, a falsification exercise found no significant increase in immunizations for children 12-23 months of age in the same period. Although the proportion completing any antenatal care (ANC) visit remained above 95% of all reported pregnancies and there was a significant increase in facility-based deliveries, the proportion of women completing 4+ ANC visits was significantly lower during the voucher programme.CONCLUSIONS: A positive association was observed between vouchers and facility-based deliveries in Nairobi. Although there is a need for higher quality evidence and validation in future studies, this statistically significant and policy relevant finding suggests that increases in facility-based deliveries can be achieved through output-based finance models that target subsidies to underserved populations.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=czs030"

The H5N1 HPAI panzootic affecting Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe has been the largest among these, affecting poultry and/or wild birds in 63 countries. A stamping-out programme achieved eradication in 24 of these epizootics (and is close to achieving eradication in the current H5N2 epizootic in South African ostriches), but vaccination was added to the control programmes in four epizootics when stamping out alone was not effective. During the 2002 to 2010 period, more than 113 billion doses of avian influenza (AI) vaccine were used in at-risk national poultry populations of over 131 billion birds. At two to three doses per bird for the 15 vaccinating countries, the average national vaccination coverage rate was 41.9% and the global AI vaccine coverage rate was 10.9% for all poultry. The highest national coverage rate was nearly 100% for poultry in Hong Kong and the lowest national coverage was less than 0.01% for poultry in Israel and The Netherlands. Inactivated AI vaccines accounted for 95.5% and live recombinant virus vaccines for 4.5% of the vaccines used. Most of these vaccines were used in the H5N1 HPAI panzootic, with more than 99% employed in the People's Republic of China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam. Implementation of vaccination in these four countries occurred after H5N1 HPAI became enzootic in domestic poultry and vaccination did not result in the enzootic infections. Vaccine usage prevented clinical disease and mortality in chickens, and maintained rural livelihoods and food security during HPAI outbreaks. Low-pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza (LPNAI) became reportable to the World Organisation for Animal Health in 2006 because some H5 and H7 low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses have the potential to mutate to HPAI viruses. Fewer outbreaks of LPNAI have been reported than of HPAI and only six countries used vaccine in control programmes, accounting for 8.1% of the total H5/H7 AI vaccine usage, as compared to 91.9% of the vaccine used against HPAI. Of the six countries that have used vaccine to control LPNAI, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Italy have been the biggest users. In countries with enzootic HPAI and LPNAI, development and implementation of exit strategies has been difficult.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435196"

Indicators of morbidity and the prevalence of infection, as well as production and demographic indicators (recorded in the present survey ortaken from secondary sources), were used to rank the potential costs and benefits of various control programmes for tropical theileriosis over a time horizon of 15 years. Three options were considered, i.e. vaccination with a local attenuated cell-line vaccine; partial barn upgrading, based on first roughcasting then smoothing all the walls of the animal premises (inner and outer surfaces); and applying acaricides to control the vector tick population on the cattle. The most important loss from this disease, representing between 22% and 38% of the overall losses, is the loss in milk yield from carriers of T. annulata. Upgrading barns produced the highest mean benefit-cost ratio (1.62 to 3.71), while the ratios for vaccination and acaricides ranged from 0.20 to 1.19 and 0.32 to 0.88, respectively. However, the benefit-cost ratio of vaccination increased (from 1.65 to 5.41), when the costs due to carrier state infection, which vaccination does not prevent, were ignored. Upgrading barns is a sustainable eradication policy against tropical theileriosis, based on a single investment, and is environmentally friendly. This control option should be encouraged by national Veterinary Authorities in regions where tropical theileriosis is transmitted by a domestic endophilic tick.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22435189"

These goals are to: (1) reach ≥90% and ≥80% vaccination coverage at national and district level, respectively; and (2) reduce measles-related mortality by 90% compared with the 2000 level. Fifty cMYPs were analysed along the four strategic areas of the GIVS: (1) protecting more people in a changing world; (2) introducing new vaccines and technologies; (3) integrating immunization, other health interventions and surveillance in the health system context; and (4) immunizing in the context of global interdependence. By 2010, all 50 countries planned to have introduced hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine, 48 the Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine and only a few countries had firm plans to introduce pneumococcal or rotavirus vaccines. Countries seem to be inadequately prepared in terms of cold-chain requirements to deal with the expected increases in storage that will be required for vaccines, and in making provisions to establish a corresponding surveillance system for planned new vaccine introductions. Immunization contacts are used to deliver other health interventions, especially in the countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region. The cost for the planned immunization activities will double to U$27 per infant, of which U$5 per infant is the expected shortfall.

An existing deterministic model was adapted to allow study of dog-to-human rabies transmission. Model parameters were fitted to data from routine weekly reports on the number of rabid dogs and human rabies exposures in N'Djamena, Chad. At the onset of study, the estimated effective reproductive ratio (Re) was 1.01 indicating stable low-level endemic rabies transmission. Simulations were performed to determine what effects mass vaccination and culling of dogs would have on the incidence of human rabies. Findings showed that a mass campaign allowing single parenteral vaccination of at least 70% of the canine population would be sufficient to interrupt transmission of rabies to humans for at least 6 years. The cost-effectiveness of mass dog vaccination was compared to that of &quot;postexposure prophylaxis&quot; (PEP) which would not reduce future human exposure. Results showed that a sustained 5-year PEP program together with a dog-vaccination campaign would be as cost-effective as PEP alone. Beyond a time-frame of 7 years, combining parenteral dog vaccination campaigns with human PEP appeared to be more cost-effective than human PEP alone.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22393628"

HCV is most common in underdeveloped nations, including many in Africa and Asia. The virus is usually transmitted by parenteral routes, but sexual, perinatal, and other types of transfer have been known to occur. Approximately 80% of individuals who contract hepatitis C develop a chronic infection, and very few are able to spontaneously clear the virus. Because hepatitis C is asymptomatic in the majority of patients, the presence of HCV RNA in the serum is the best diagnostic tool. Although serious complications from hepatitis C may not occur for 20 years, 1/5 of chronic patients eventually develop life - threatening cirrhosis. More research is needed on the different therapy options for the disease, and many factors, most importantly the genotype of the virus, must be taken into account before beginning any treatment. As there is no vaccine against HCV at present, the most effective and recommended therapy is pegylated-interferon-α-2a plus ribavirin. While interferon is marginally effective as a monotherapy, both adding the moiety and combining it with ribavirin have been shown to dramatically increase its potency. While there are numerous alternative and complementary medicines available for patients with hepatitis C, their efficacy is questionable. Currently, research is being done to investigate other possible treatments for hepatitis C, and progress is being made to develop a vaccine against HCV, despite the many challenges the virus presents. Until such a vaccination is available, prevention and control methods are important in containing and impeding the spread of the virus and mitigating its deleterious effects on the health of people and communities worldwide.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1743-422X-9-57"

The multiplex capabilities of the system conserve time, money and sample, while generating statistically powerful data.OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the use of the assay by comparing the humoral influenza-specific responses of two cohorts from two countries that differed in circulating influenza strains and rates of influenza vaccination.METHODS: Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from different strains were coated on microbeads and incubated with serum samples to capture immunoglobulin (Ig) A(1) and IgG(1) host antibodies.RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in IgA(1) and IgG(1) exist between the serum samples from Winnipeg (Manitoba) donors and those from Kenyan (Africa) donors. Data were compared using Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests. The Winnipeg donors had higher mean fluorescence intensity values, with significant P values for anti-HA IgA(1) to A/Wyoming/3/2003 (P=0.044), A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (P=0.0179), A/New Caledonia/20/99 (P&lt;0.0001) and B/Tokyo/53/99 (P=0.0002). No differences were seen between the groups in their response to B/Jilin/20/2003. The Winnipeg donors had higher mean fluorescence intensity values, with significant P values for anti-HA IgG(1) to A/Wyoming/3/2003 (P=0.0135), B/Tokyo/53/99 (P=0.006) and B/Jilin20/2003 (P=0.026).CONCLUSION: Influenza-specific IgA(1) and IgG(1) antibodies were successfully detected using MBA technology. A significant difference in antibody response was observed between Winnipeg and Kenyan donor serums. MBA analysis is a relatively quick and cost-effective method for serum antibody analysis. The potential to simultaneously assay small sample volumes for a multitude of antigens makes this method invaluable for future vaccine response monitoring.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22379485"

Studies were included if they measured effectiveness in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) or death averted.RESULTS: Child nutrition and maternal and neonatal health interventions were found to be highly cost-effective (most of them below US$200 per DALY averted for nutritional interventions and US$100 for maternal and neonatal health). For dengue, information on cost-effectiveness was found just for application of larvicides, which resulted in a cost per DALY averted ranking from US$40.79 to US$345.06. Malarial interventions were found to be cost-effective (below US$150 per DALY averted or US$4,000 per death averted within Africa). In the case of pneumococcus and rotavirus vaccination, cost-effectiveness estimates were always above one GDP per capita per DALY averted.CONCLUSIONS: In Mesoamerica there are still important challenges in child nutrition, vaccination, malaria, dengue and maternal, neonatal, and reproductive health, challenges that could be addressed by scaling-up technically feasible and cost-effective interventions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0036-36342011000900011"

Vaccination visits provide a platform for delivery of other health services but may overburden nurses. We compared 2 strategies to integrate hygiene interventions with vaccinations in Kenya's Homa Bay district, 1 using community workers to support nurses and 1 using nurses.METHODS: Homa Bay was divided into 2 geographical areas, each with 9 clinics. Each area was randomly assigned to either the nurse or community-assisted strategy. At infant vaccination visits hygiene kits were distributed by the nurse or community member. Surveys pre- and post-intervention, measured hygiene indicators and vaccination coverage. Interviews and focus groups assessed acceptability.RESULTS: Between April 2009 and March 2010, 39 158 hygiene kits were distributed. Both nurse and community-assisted strategies were well-accepted. Hygiene indicators improved similarly in nurse and community sites. However, residual chlorine in water changed in neither group. Vaccination coverage increased in urban areas. In rural areas coverage either remained unchanged or increased with 1 exception (13% third dose poliovirus vaccine decrease).CONCLUSIONS: Distribution of hygiene products and education during vaccination visits was found to be feasible using both delivery strategies. Additional studies should consider assessing the use of community members to support integrated service delivery.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=jir777"

Yet knowledge gaps remain regarding community members and health workers acceptance, priorities, and concerns related to integration.METHODS: Qualitative health worker interviews and community focus groups were conducted in 4 African countries (Kenya, Mali, Ethiopia, and Cameroon).RESULTS: Integration was generally well accepted by both community members and health workers. Most integrated services were perceived positively by the communities, although perceptions around socially sensitive services (eg, family planning and human immunodeficiency virus) differed by country. Integration benefits reported by both community members and health workers across countries included opportunity to receive multiple services at one visit, time and transportation cost savings, increased service utilization, maximized health worker efficiency, and reduced reporting requirements. Concerns related to integration included being labor intensive, inadequate staff to implement, inadequately trained staff, in addition to a number of more broad health system issues (eg, stockouts, wait times).CONCLUSIONS: Communities generally supported integration, and integrated services may have the potential to increase service utilization and possibly even reduce the stigma of certain services. Some concerns expressed related to health system issues rather than integration, per se, and should be addressed as part of a wider approach to improve health services. Improved planning and patient flow and increasing the number and training of health staff may help to mitigate logistical challenges of integrating services.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=jir796"

In countries with a weak health infrastructure, this strategy could be used to reach many underserved populations with an integrated package of services. In this study, we estimate the incremental costs, impact, cost-effectiveness, and return on investment of 2 rounds of CHDs that were conducted in Somalia in 2009 and 2010.METHODS: We use program costs and population estimates reported by the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund to estimate the average cost per beneficiary for each of 9 interventions delivered during 2 rounds of CHDs implemented during the periods of December 2008 to May 2009 and August 2009 to April 2010. Because unstable areas were unreachable, we calculated costs for targeted and accessible beneficiaries. We model the impact of the CHDs on child mortality using the Lives Saved Tool, convert these estimates of mortality reduction to life years saved, and derive the cost-effectiveness ratio and the return on investment.RESULTS: The estimated average incremental cost per intervention for each targeted beneficiary was $0.63, with the cost increasing to $0.77 per accessible beneficiary. The CHDs were estimated to save the lives of at least 10,000, or 500,000 life years for both rounds combined. The CHDs were cost-effective at $34.00/life year saved. For every $1 million invested in the strategy, an estimated 615 children's lives, or 29,500 life years, were saved. If the pentavalent vaccine had been delivered during the CHDs instead of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, an additional 5000 children's lives could have been saved.CONCLUSIONS: Despite high operational costs, CHDs are a very cost-effective service delivery strategy for addressing the leading causes of child mortality in a conflict setting like Somalia and compare favorably with other interventions rated as health sector &quot;best buys&quot; in sub-Saharan Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=jir772"

Recently introduced rotavirus vaccines from Merck &amp; Co. and GlaxoSmithKline have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. Efficacy results in Ghana suggest Merck &amp; Co.'s live oral pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq(®)) prevents 65.0% of severe gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection in children under 5. The announcement by Merck and GSK to make their rotavirus vaccines available for developing nations at reduced prices provides Ghana with the opportunity to introduce rotavirus vaccines into the national immunization program after investigation of the medical, economic and political implications.METHODS: We estimated the average costs of treating children with diarrhea in the Ashanti region of Ghana as inpatients and outpatients. Using these results, data from rotavirus surveillance studies, and recent rotavirus vaccine efficacy evaluation, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of introducing RotaTeq in Ghana.RESULTS: Based on our prospective calculations, we estimated an average inpatient and outpatient costs of $233.97 and $17.09, respectively, for treating childhood diarrhea. Using the 2003 birth cohort, RotaTeq introduction could save 1554 lives and avert 93,109 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) annually. At a market price of $5 per dose, introducing RotaTeq would have a base-case cost of $62.26 per DALY averted, at a market price of $3.50 per dose, a base-case cost of $39.59 per DALY averted and at market cost of $1 per dose, a base-case cost of $1.81 per DALY averted. All three values are below the 2009 Ghana per capita GDP. Thus, RotaTeq introduction into Ghana will be very cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses suggest these results are robust.CONCLUSIONS: RotaTeq vaccination for children under five in Ghana would be a highly cost-effective public health intervention. Ghanaian health officials should seek GAVI funding and evaluate how to maximize RotaTeq access.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)00114-4"

In urban areas, the control of the diseaseis expected to be hampered by several unique constraints.OBJECTIVE: To appraise the occurrence and control of rabies.STUDY DESIGN: The tools used in the study included key informant interviews with senior veterinary and medical officers and a questionnaire survey on 15 veterinary officers and 9 human physicians. The occurrence of animal bites and costs involved in treatment was also investigated using retrospective hospital data for the year 2007.SETTING: Kisumu Municipality, Kenya.RESULTS: The control of rabies was under the Veterinary Department through dog vaccinations and baiting, and also under the Department of Public Health (DPH) through people vaccinations and post exposure treatments. The constraints observed were poor coordination in rabies control efforts, understaffing and limited resources. Animal bites were common with 1270 cases reported during 2007. The post-bite rabies vaccines were mainly purchased from local chemists at KES 7,500 per full dose. This amounted to an annual total cost of KES 9,525,000 (136,071 USD). The bites were mainly from domestic dogs (89%) and occurred commonly in highly populated areas. The mean age of people with bites was 21 (2.5 - 78) years, showing that young people had a higher risk. Males (59%) were at higher risk of bites than females (41%).CONCLUSIONS: It would be important for the relevant departments to harmonise their rabies control strategies and also address the prevalent constraints by using local networks. The incidence of rabies and the associated epidemiology needs proper updated documentation with a view of carrying out mass vaccination of dogs at times free of cost to the economically disadvantaged owners.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26845813"

For each country, the national coverage gap was determined for an overall health service coverage index and select individual health service indicators. The data were then additively broken down into the coverage gap in the wealthiest quintile (i.e. the proportion of the quintile lacking a required health service) and the population attributable risk (an absolute measure of within-country wealth-related inequality).FINDINGS: In 26 countries, within-country wealth-related inequality accounted for more than one quarter of the national overall coverage gap. Reducing such inequality could lower this gap by 16% to 56%, depending on the country. Regarding select individual health service indicators, wealth-related inequality was more common in services such as skilled birth attendance and antenatal care, and less so in family planning, measles immunization, receipt of a third dose of vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus and treatment of acute respiratory infections in children under 5 years of age.CONCLUSION: The contribution of wealth-related inequality to the child and maternal health service coverage gap differs by country and type of health service, warranting case-specific interventions. Targeted policies are most appropriate where high within-country wealth-related inequality exists, and whole-population approaches, where the health-service coverage gap is high in all quintiles.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.2471/BLT.11.087536"

HBV is most prevalent in China, South East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Amazon basin of South America where health care resources are most limited. Numerous challenges exist for effective management of chronic HBV infection, particularly in resource-limited regions. These challenges include lack of accurate prevalence data, absence of a surveillance program, and poor political will of governments in resource-poor countries to enforce effective measures to control the disease. There is a lack of understanding regarding HBV infec-tion by both the general public and health care providers. A better understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of this condition is necessary. The acute shortage of trained medical manpower necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepati-tis B (CHB) in resource-poor countries is a formidable challenge. The condition is com-plicated by the continuing efflux of medical graduates from low-income economies to richer countries. The most critical problem in the management of CHB is the high cost of laboratory tests and drugs. Drugs are also not readily available. Other challenges in the manage-ment of CHB include stigmatization of patients, co-infection with other viruses, lack of management guidelines, and absence of an effective patient referral system. To address these challenges, governments of resource-poor nations must be committed to budg-etary allocation for the implementation of health programs. It is necessary to provide awareness campaigns, health education, proper screening of blood and blood products for transfusion, active screening, intensification of existing childhood immunization, technical and financial assistance from wealthier nations, and implementation of the recommendations outlined in the Global Hepatitis Policy (2010).","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.5812/kowsar.1735143X.757"

Both &quot;naturally&quot; occurring pathogens, such as Ebola and Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), and respiratory pathogens transmitted from humans, have been confirmed as important sources of mortality in wild gorillas and chimpanzees. While awareness of the threat has increased, interventions such as vaccination and treatment remain controversial. Here we explore both the risk of disease to African apes, and the status of potential responses. Through synthesis of published data, we summarize prior disease impact on African apes. We then use a simple demographic model to illustrate the resilience of a well-known gorilla population to disease, modeled on prior documented outbreaks. We found that the predicted recovery time for this specific gorilla population from a single outbreak ranged from 5 years for a low mortality (4%) respiratory outbreak, to 131 years for an Ebola outbreak that killed 96% of the population. This shows that mortality rates comparable to those recently reported for disease outbreaks in wild populations are not sustainable. This is particularly troubling given the rising pathogen risk created by increasing habituation of wild apes for tourism, and the growth of human populations surrounding protected areas. We assess potential future disease spillover risk in terms of vaccination rates amongst humans that may come into contact with wild apes, and the availability of vaccines against potentially threatening diseases. We discuss and evaluate non-interventionist responses such as limiting tourist access to apes, community health programs, and safety, logistic, and cost issues that constrain the potential of vaccination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0029030"

The WHO and UNAIDS recommend male circumcision as an additional intervention to prevent HIV infection. Tanzania is embarking on activities to scale up safe male circumcision for HIV prevention and other related health benefits. In line with this, it is crucial to assess views of the population using specific groups. This paper describes perceptions on male circumcision and strategies of enhancing uptake of male circumcision in urban Tanzania using members of the police force. This cross sectional survey was conducted among members of the police force in Dar es Salaam Tanzania from January 2010 to July 2010. The police officer serves as a source of the clinical trial participants in on-going phase I/II HIV vaccine trials. Three hundred and thirteen (313) police officers responded to a self-administered questionnaire that comprised of socio-demographic characteristics, reasons for not circumcising, perceptions regarding circumcision, methods of enhancing male circumcision, communication means and barriers to promote circumcision. This was followed by a physical examination to determine male circumcision status. The prevalence of circumcision was 96%. Most (69%) reported to have been circumcised in the hospital. The reported barriers to male circumcision among adults and children were: anticipation of pain, cost, fear to lose body parts, and lack of advice for adult's circumcision. Sensitization of parents who take children to the reproductive and child health services was recommended by most respondents as the appropriate strategy to promote male circumcision. The least recommended strategy was for the women to sensitize men. Use of radio programs and including male circumcision issues in school curricula as means of enhancing community sensitization regarding male circumcision were also highly recommended. Other recommendations include use of public media, seminars at work and issuance of circumcision regulations by health authorities. In conclusion, the present study reveals male circumcision was common in a selected urban population. There are various barriers and channels of communication regarding male circumcision. In view of scaling male circumcision in Tanzania, use of radio messages, inclusion of male circumcision in the school curricula and sensitization at the reproductive and child health clinics are likely to promote early medical male circumcision.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26591748"

Global health donors assist the country with a number of community-oriented interventions such as free distribution of bednets, antihelminthic drugs, vitamin A supplementation and vaccination campaigns, but uptake of these interventions is not always optimal. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of poor urban communities of the capital Kinshasa with regard to health issues in general as well as their experiences and expectations concerning facility-based health services and community-oriented health interventions. Applying an approach rooted in the grounded theory framework, focus group discussions were conducted in eight neighborhoods of poor urban areas in the city of Kinshasa in July 2011. Study participants were easily able to evoke the city's major health problems, with the notable exceptions of malnutrition and HIV/AIDS. They perceive the high out-of-pocket cost of health services as the major obstacle when seeking access to quality care. Knowledge of ongoing community-oriented health interventions seems good. Still, while the study participants agree that those interventions are beneficial; their acceptability seems to be problematic. This is chiefly put down to a lack of information and government communication about the programs and their interventions. Furthermore, the study participants referred to rumors and the deterring effect of stories about alleged harmful consequences of those interventions. Along with improving the provision and quality of general health care, the government and international actors must improve their efforts in informing the communities about disease control programs, their rationale and benefit/risk ratio. Directly engaging community members in a dialogue might be beneficial in terms of improving acceptability and overall access to health services and interventions. Novel ways of reducing the high out-of-pocket expenditure should also be explored.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0084314"

CBPP is a barrier to trade in many African countries and this reduces the value of livestock and the income of many value chain stakeholders. The presence of CBPP also poses a constant threat to CBPP-free countries and creates costs in terms of the measures necessary to ensure the exclusion of disease. This opinion focuses on the biomedical research needed to foster the development of better control measures for CBPP. We suggest that different vaccine development approaches are followed in parallel. Basic immunology studies and systematic OMICs studies will be necessary in order to identify the protective arms of immunity and to shed more light on the pathogenicity mechanisms in CBPP.

Stool specimens from cases were tested for rotavirus using a commercially available assay.RESULTS: From June 2009 to May 2011, rotavirus was detected in 3985 (36%) of 10,953 children hospitalized for gastroenteritis, with detection rates ranging from 25% to 48% at the 8 hospitals. Approximately 61% of the rotavirus hospitalizations occurred before 1 year of age and most (91%) occurred before 2 years of age. Rotavirus was detected year-round in Sudan with peaks during March to May and November to December. Applying rotavirus prevalence to national estimates of diarrhea events, we calculated 9800 deaths, 22,800 hospitalizations and 55,400 outpatient visits related to rotavirus per year among children &lt;5 years of age in Sudan.CONCLUSIONS: The high burden of rotavirus disease in Sudan indicates that the recently implemented vaccination program should substantially improve child health in Sudan. This nationwide rotavirus surveillance system will be an important platform for assessing the benefits and value of rotavirus vaccine in a developing country setting.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/INF.0000000000000095"

The recombinant envelope 2 (rE2) protein of CHIKV is a potential diagnostic as well as vaccine candidate. Development of cost-effective cultivation media and appropriate culture conditions are generally favorable for large-scale production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The effects of medium composition and cultivation conditions on the production of recombinant Chikungunya virus E2 (rCHIKV E2) protein were investigated in shake flask culture as well as batch cultivation of Escherichia coli. Further, the fed-batch process was also carried out for high cell density cultivation of E. coli expressing rE2 protein. Expression of rCHIKV E2 protein in E. coli was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at ~23 g dry cell weight (DCW) per liter of culture and yielded an insoluble protein aggregating to form inclusion bodies. The final DCW after fed-batch cultivation was ~35 g/l. The inclusion bodies were isolated, solubilized in 8 M urea and purified through affinity chromatography to give a final product yield of ~190 mg/l. The reactivity of purified E2 protein was confirmed by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results show that rE2 protein of CHIKV may be used as a diagnostic reagent or for further prophylactic studies. This approach of producing rE2 protein in E. coli with high yield may also offer a promising method for production of other viral recombinant proteins.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s00253-013-5426-4"

We synthesized population and epidemiologic data for 20 EMENA countries using a model-based approach to estimate averted cervical cancer cases and deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and cost-effectiveness ratios (I$ [international dollars] per DALY averted) associated with HPV vaccination of pre-adolescent girls. We utilized additional epidemiologic data from Algeria, Lebanon, and Turkey to evaluate select cervical cancer screening strategies either alone or in combination with vaccination. Results showed that pre-adolescent vaccination of five consecutive birth cohorts at 70% coverage has the potential to prevent over 180,000 cervical cancer cases. Cases averted varied by country, largely due to differences in cancer burden and population size; 69% of cases averted occurred in the three GAVI-eligible countries in EMENA. Despite the low cervical cancer incidence in EMENA, we found that HPV vaccination was cost-effective using a threshold of each country's gross domestic product per capita (a common metric for evaluating cost-effectiveness) in all but five countries at a cost per vaccinated girl of I$25 ($5 per dose). However, cost-effectiveness diminished with increasing vaccine cost; at a cost of I$200 per vaccinated girl, HPV vaccination was cost-effective in only five countries. When the cost per vaccinated girl exceeded I$50 in Lebanon and Turkey and I$150 in Algeria, screening alone was most attractive. We identified opportunities to improve upon current national screening guidelines, involving less frequent screening every 3-5 years. While pre-adolescent HPV vaccination promises to be a cost-effective strategy in most EMENA countries at low costs, decision makers will need to consider many other factors, such as affordability, acceptability, feasibility, and competing health priorities, when making decisions about cervical cancer prevention.

Consequently, most cervical cancers are diagnosed late and are associated with high mortality. In fact, in most of these countries, national mortality data are unknown due to the absence of population-based mortality registries. Most countries of the EMENA practice more or less limited opportunistic, cytology-based, screening tests, which often lack quality assurance and follow-up care. A few countries, within the initiation of a National Cancer Control Plan, have just started to implement organized screening programs using, for cervical cancer detection, visual inspection with acetic acid (Morocco) or cytology (Turkey). Moreover, most countries of the EMENA lack national guideline, as well as resources for the management of abnormal cytologic screening (or any other screening test). The main obstacle for the implementation of NOCCS is a lack of political understanding to support such public health programs and provide the necessary resources. Other obstacles that hinder the participation of women in cervical screening include a lack of knowledge of the disease, socio-religious and cultural barriers, and geographic and economic difficulties in accessing medical services. These countries are already convinced that prevention of cervical cancers in women who have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is possible through various screening and treatment algorithms, but most countries still need to invest in well organized programs that can reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality in women.

Additional epidemiologic data from Uganda and South Africa informed estimates of cancer risk reduction and cost-effectiveness ratios associated with pre-adolescent female vaccination followed by screening of women over age 30. Assuming 70% vaccination coverage, over 670,000 cervical cancer cases would be prevented among women in five consecutive birth cohorts vaccinated as young adolescents; over 90% of cases averted were projected to occur in countries eligible for GAVI Alliance support. There were large variations in health benefits across countries attributable to differential cancer rates, population size, and population age structure. More than half of DALYs averted in sub-Saharan Africa were in Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, and Mozambique. When the cost per vaccinated girl was I$5 ($0.55 per dose), HPV vaccination was cost-saving in 38 sub-Saharan African countries, and cost I$300 per DALY averted or less in the remaining countries. At this vaccine price, pre-adolescent HPV vaccination followed by screening three times per lifetime in adulthood cost I$300 per year of life saved (YLS) in Uganda (per capita GDP I$1,140) and I$1,000 per YLS in South Africa (per capita GDP I$9,480).

Two licensed vaccines could be life- and cost-saving in low-income countries where the disease burden is highest. The aim of our study was to estimate the total cost of implementing the rotavirus vaccine in the national immunisation programme of a low-income country. Furthermore, the aim was to examine the relative contribution of different components to the total cost.METHODS: Following the World Health Organization guidelines, we estimated the resource use and costs associated with rotavirus vaccine implementation, using Malawi as a case. The cost analysis was undertaken from a governmental perspective. All costs were calculated for a 5-years period (2012-2016) and discounted at 5%. The value of key input parameters was varied in a sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: The total cost of rotavirus vaccine implementation in Malawi amounted to US$ 18.5 million over a 5-years period. This translated into US$ 5.8 per child in the birth cohort. With GAVI Alliance financial support, the total cost was reduced to US$ 1.4 per child in the birth cohort. Approximately 83% of the total cost was attributed to vaccine purchase, while 17% was attributed to system costs, with personnel, transportation and cold chain as the main cost components.CONCLUSION: The total cost of rotavirus vaccine implementation in Malawi is high compared with the governmental health budget of US$ 26 per capita per year. This highlights the need for new financing opportunities for low-income countries to facilitate vaccine implementation and ensure sustainable financing.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24314006"

Substantial number of reported cholera cases in some provinces during and after the epidemic in 2008-09 indicates a plausible presence of seasonality in cholera incidence in those regions. We formulate a compartmental mathematical model with periodic slow-fast transmission rate to study such recurrent occurrences and fitted the model to cumulative cholera cases and deaths for different provinces of Zimbabwe from the beginning of cholera outbreak in 2008-09 to June 2011. Daily and weekly reported cholera incidence data were collected from Zimbabwe epidemiological bulletin, Zimbabwe Daily cholera updates and Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs Zimbabwe (OCHA, Zimbabwe). For each province, the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) in periodic environment is estimated. To the best of our knowledge, this is probably a pioneering attempt to estimate [Formula: see text] in periodic environment using real-life data set of cholera epidemic for Zimbabwe.

Additional 3-4 millions are newly-infected annually. Prevalence of pediatric infection varies from 0.05%-0.36% in the United States and Europe; up to 1.8%-5.8% in some developing countries. The highest prevalence occurs in Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, Amazon basin and Mongolia. HCV has been present in some populations for several centuries, notably genotypes 1 and 2 in West Africa. Parenteral anti-schistosomal therapy practiced in the 1960s until the early 1980s had spread HCV infection throughout Egypt. Parenteral acquisition of HCV remains a major route for infection among Egyptian children. Insufficient screening of transfusions, unsterilized injection equipment and re-used needles and syringes continue to be major routes of HCV transmission in developing countries, whereas vertical transmission and adolescent high-risk behaviors (e.g., injection drug abuse) are the major routes in developed countries. The risk of vertical transmission from an infected mother to her unborn/newborn infant is approximately 5%. Early stages of HCV infection in children do not lead to marked impairment in the quality of life nor to cognitive, behavioral or emotional dysfunction; however, caregiver stress and family system strain may occur. HCV slowly progresses to serious complications as cirrhosis (1%-2%) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) especially in the presence of risk factors as hemolytic anemias, obesity, treated malignancy, and concomitant human immune deficiency and/or hepatitis B virus co-infection. HCV vaccine remains elusive to date. Understanding the immune mechanisms in patients who successfully cleared the infection is essential for vaccine development. The pediatric standard of care treatment consists of pegylated interferon-α 2a or b plus ribavirin for 24-48 wk. The new oral direct acting antivirals, approved for adults, need further evaluation in children. Sustained virologic response varies depending on the viral load, genotype, duration of infection, degree of aminotransferase elevation, adiposity and single nucleotide polymorphisms of interleukin (IL)-28B locus. The goals of treatment in individual patients are virus eradication, prevention of cirrhosis and HCC, and removing stigmatization; meanwhile the overall goal is decreasing the global burden of HCV. IL-28B polymorphisms have been also associated with spontaneous clearance of vertically acquired HCV infection. The worldwide economic burden of HCV for children, families and countries is estimated to be hundreds of millions of US dollars per year. The United States, alone, is estimated to spend 199-336 million dollars in screening, monitoring and treatment during one decade. The emotional burden of having an HCV infected child in a family is more difficult to estimate.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.3748/wjg.v19.i44.7880"

Mathematical models have estimated the potential real-life impact of vaccination on the burden of cervical cancer (CC). However, these are restricted to evaluations in a limited number of countries.METHODS: Potential decline in CC cases and deaths with the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine of young girls naïve to HPV, was estimated at steady-state (vaccine coverage: 0-100%) based on clinical trial and country-specific incidence data. Data on vaccine efficacy were taken from the end of study PATRICIA trial of the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine. The numbers of cases and deaths due to HPV-16/18 were estimated and compared with those due to any HPV type to estimate the additional cases prevented. This difference estimates CC cases and deaths avoided due to protection against non-vaccine HPV types. Cost-offsets due to reductions in CC treatment were estimated for five countries (Brazil, Canada, Italy, Malaysia and South African Republic) using country-specific unit cost data. Additionally, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN2/3)-related burden (cases and treatment costs) prevented by vaccination were estimated for two countries (Italy and Malaysia).RESULTS: HPV vaccination could prevent a substantial number of CC cases and deaths in countries worldwide, with associated cost-offsets due to reduced CC treatment. Cross-protection increased the estimated potential number of CC cases and deaths prevented by 34 and 18% in Africa and Oceania, respectively. Moreover, vaccination could result in a substantial reduction in the number of CIN2/3 lesions and associated costs.CONCLUSION: HPV vaccination could reduce the burden of CC and precancerous lesions in countries worldwide, part of disease burden reduction being related to protection against non HPV-16/18 related types.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24291200"

The COI was computed from a retrospective review of 80 meningitis cases answers to questions about direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs incurred and productivity losses due to recent meningitis incident.RESULTS: The average direct and indirect costs of treating meningitis in the district was GH¢152.55 (US$101.7) per household. This is equivalent to about two months minimum wage earned by Ghanaians in unskilled paid jobs in 2009. Households lost 29 days of work per meningitis case and thus those in minimum wage paid jobs lost a monthly minimum wage of GH¢76.85 (US$51.23) due to the illness. Patients who were insured spent an average of GH¢38.5 (US$25.67) in direct medical costs whiles the uninsured patients spent as much as GH¢177.9 (US$118.6) per case.

We evaluated the impact of the Ethiopian Millennium Rural Initiative (EMRI), an 18-month systems-based intervention to improve the performance of 30 primary health care units in rural areas of Ethiopia.METHODS: We assessed the impact of EMRI on maternal and child survival using The Lives Saved Tool (LiST), Demography (DemProj) and AIDS Impact Model (AIM) tools in Spectrum software, inputting monthly data on 6 indicators 1) antenatal coverage (ANC), 2) skilled birth attendance coverage (SBA), 3) post-natal coverage (PNC), 4) HIV testing during ANC, 5) measles vaccination coverage, and 6) pentavalent 3 vaccination coverages. We calculated a cost-benefit ratio of the EMRI program including lives saved during implementation and lives saved during implementation and 5 year follow-up.RESULTS: A total of 134 lives (all children) were estimated to have been saved due to the EMRI interventions during the 18-month intervention in 30 health centers and their catchment areas, with an estimated additional 852 lives (820 children and 2 adults) saved during the 5-year post-EMRI period. For the 18-month intervention period, EMRI cost $37,313 per life saved ($42,366 per life if evaluation costs are included). Calculated over the 18-month intervention plus 5 years post-intervention, EMRI cost $5,875 per life saved ($6,671 per life if evaluation costs are included). The cost effectiveness of EMRI improves substantially if the performance achieved during the 18 months of the EMRI intervention is sustained for 5 years. Scaling up EMRI to operate for 5 years across the 4 major regions of Ethiopia could save as many as 34,908 lives.SIGNIFICANCE: A systems-based approach to improving primary care in low-income settings can have transformational impact on lives saved and be cost-effective.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0079847"

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been licensed in Morocco since 2008 but there are no available data on their acceptability. This study aimed to assess awareness of HPV and the vaccine, and to identify factors associated with acceptability of the vaccine among parents in Morocco. We carried out a questionnaire-based survey using face-to-face interviews in a sample of 852 parents (670 mothers and 182 fathers) with at least one unmarried daughter ≤26 years. We collected data within public and private health centres and clinics in four regions in Morocco between July and August 2012. The main outcome measure was parental acceptability of the HPV vaccine for their daughter(s). Responses revealed very low awareness of HPV infection (4.7%) and the HPV vaccine (14.3%). None of the participants had vaccinated their daughter(s) against HPV and vaccine acceptability was low among mothers (32%) and fathers (45%). Higher education and income, previous awareness of the HPV vaccine and endorsement of the belief that a recommendation from the Ministry of Health or a doctor to have the vaccine would be encouraging, were associated with mothers' HPV vaccine acceptability. Non-acceptability among mothers was associated with having more than two daughters, believing the vaccine was expensive, lack of information and believing that whatever happens to an individual's health is God's will. The only factor associated with the fathers' acceptability of the vaccine was the cost of the vaccine. Increasing HPV and HPV vaccine awareness through educational campaigns, along with active recommendation by physicians and a publically funded vaccination programme could increase parental acceptability of the HPV vaccine in Morocco.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24188754"

Overall, 89.4% [95%CI:86.4-91.8%] and 87.7% [95%CI:84.2-90.6%] were vaccinated during the first round and 79.8% [95%CI:75.6-83.4%] and 82.9% [95%CI:76.6-87.7%] during the second round in Boffa and Forécariah respectively. The two dose vaccine coverage (including card and oral reporting) was 75.8% [95%CI: 71.2-75.9%] in Boffa and 75.9% [95%CI: 69.8-80.9%] in Forécariah respectively. Vaccination coverage was higher in children. The main reason for non-vaccination was absence. No severe adverse events were notified.SIGNIFICANCE: The well-accepted mass vaccination campaign reached high coverage in a remote area with a mobile population. Although OCV should not be foreseen as the long-term solution for global cholera control, they should be integrated as an additional tool into the response.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002465"

The risk factors for cholera outbreaks in Africa are incompletely understood, and the traditional emphasis on providing safe drinking water and improving sanitation and hygiene has proven remarkably insufficient to contain outbreaks. Current killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are safe and guarantee a high level of protection for several years. OCVs have been licensed for &gt;20 years, but their potential for preventing and control cholera outbreaks in Africa has not been realized. Although each item in the long list of technical reasons why cholera vaccination campaigns have been deferred is plausible, we believe that the biggest barrier is that populations affected by cholera outbreaks are underprivileged and lack a strong political voice. The evaluation and use of OCVs as a tool for cholera control will require a new, more compassionate, less risk-averse generation of decision makers.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=jit194"

The low compliance with Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) partially explains this situation. This study was aiming at studying the reasons to abandon PEP. This descriptive and cross-sectional study has taken place at the anti-rabies Center of Abidjan from October 1st to December 2009. Data were collected in two steps: we first interviewed all the patients at the anti-rabies center during their first consultation, and then phone interviews were conducted one month later, only with exposed patients who abandoned their PEP. These phone calls allowed us to complete the questionnaire (the status of the animal and PEP discontinuation). Patients' verbal informed consent was obtained prior to data collection. Besides, patients were explained the risks they were exposed to and were advised to complete immunization. The results obtained revealed that, out of 220 people included in the study, 116 (52.7%) abandoned the PEP. The compliance was lower with the protocol of five injections compared to that of four injections. More than half of the patients abandoned PEP after the first injection. In 32.8% of patients who abandoned PEP, the animal was dead, disappeared, was destroyed or there were no information about it one month after bite or scratch. Animal owners' refusal of taking in charge the victims (20%) and the lack of financial resources for purchasing the vaccine (13.6%) were the most frequent reasons to abandon PEP. To increase the protection of the human population against rabies and to increase the compliance with PEP protocols, the improvement of financial accessibility to the vaccine for population and the elaboration of compulsory regulations for animal owners to take in charge the PEP are necessary.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s13149-013-0312-y"

Unfortunately, in low-income countries (LICs), demand outweighs resources. To facilitate registration in LICs, stringent review procedures of the European Medicines Agency (EMA Article-58), Food and Drug Administration (FDA PEPFAR-linked review) and WHO Prequalification programme have been established. Only the PEPFAR-linked review gives approval, while the others make recommendations for approval. This study assessed the performance and discussed the challenges of these three stringent review procedures. Data from WHO, FDA, EMA, Medline and Internet were analysed. Over 60% of medicines reviewed by stringent review procedures are manufactured in India. Until 2012, WHO prequalified 400 medicines (211 vaccines, 130 antiretrovirals, 29 tuberculostatics, 15 antimalarials and 15 others). PEPFAR-linked review approved 156 antiretrovirals, while EMA Article 58 recommended approval of 3 antiretrovirals, 1 vaccine and 1 antimalarial. WHO Prequalification and PEPFAR-linked review are free of charge and as a result have accelerated access to antiretrovirals. They both built capacity in sub-Saharan Africa, although WHO prequalification relies technically on stringent regulatory authorities and financially on donors. Article-58 offers the largest disease coverage and strongest technical capacities, is costly and involves fewer LICs. To meet the high demand for quality medicines in LICs, these stringent review procedures need to enlarge their disease coverage. To improve registration, EMA Article 58 should actively involve LICs. Furthermore, LIC regulatory activities must not be fully resigned to stringent review procedure.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24134396"

However, the heterogeneity in immunity, due to previous vaccination coverage or infection, may lead to potential bias of such campaigns toward those with previous high access to vaccination and may result in a lower-than-expected effective impact. During the 2010 measles outbreak in Malawi, only 3 of the 8 districts where vaccination occurred achieved a measureable effective campaign impact (i.e., a reduction in measles cases in the targeted age groups greater than that observed in nonvaccinated districts). Simulation models suggest that selective campaigns targeting hard-to-reach individuals are of greater benefit, particularly in highly vaccinated populations, even for low target coverage and with late implementation. However, the choice between targeted and nonselective campaigns should be context specific, achieving a reasonable balance of feasibility, cost, and expected impact. In addition, it is critical to develop operational strategies to identify and target hard-to-reach individuals.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24131555"

This, however, requires application of highly specific diagnostic tests. This study investigated outbreaks of FMD in seven Ugandan districts, during 2011, using the PrioCHECK® FMDV NS ELISA, solid-phase blocking ELISAs (SPBEs) and virus neutralization tests (VNTs), together with virological analyses for characterization of the responsible viruses. Two hundred and eighteen (218) cattle and 23 goat sera as well as 82 oropharyngeal fluid/epithelial tissue samples were collected. Some 50% of the cattle and 17% of the goat sera were positive by the PrioCHECK® FMDV NS ELISA, while SPBEs identified titres ≥80 for antibodies against serotype O FMD virus (FMDV) in 51% of the anti-NSP positive cattle sera. However, 35% of the anti-NSP positive cattle sera had SPBE titres ≥80 against multiple serotypes, primarily against serotypes O, SAT 1 and SAT 3. Comparison of SPBEs and VNTs for the detection of antibodies against serotypes O, SAT 1 and SAT 3 in 72 NSP positive cattle sera showed comparable results against serotype O (P = 0.181), while VNTs detected significantly fewer samples positive for antibodies against SAT 1 and SAT 3 than the SPBEs (P &lt; 0.001). Detection of antibodies against serotype O was consistent with the isolation of serotype O FMDVs from 13 samples. Four of these viruses were sequenced and belonged to two distinct lineages within the East Africa-2 (EA-2) topotype, each differing from the currently used vaccine strain (EA-1 topotype). The relationships of these lineages to other serotype O viruses in the Eastern Africa region are discussed. To enhance the control of FMD in Uganda, there is need to improve the specificity of the SAT-SPBEs, perform vaccine matching and implement improved regional FMD control.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24118785"

Therefore, the current bivalent and quadrivalent anti-HPV vaccines are unlikely to achieve their target in the developing world.

This paper tries to understand the main barriers to better coverage.METHODS: These barriers were categorised as up or downstream against the health system building blocks as proposed by WHO and compared with barriers and activities identified by the country in its health system's strengthening grant proposal as approved by the GAVI Alliance in 2007. Data were collected using a modified Delphi system and by analysis of grant and annual report documents.RESULTS: Most of the activities anticipated under the GAVI health system's strengthening proposal are activities targeting downstream barriers (the neglect of upstream issues is of major importance in a decentralised state like Chad) and aligned with, not complementary to, immunization services strengthening activities. Further, both set of cash grants are blind to important recommendations such as the need to address barriers at the level of leadership and governance and at the level of the financing system and also about initiatives to promote community demand of vaccination services.CONCLUSION: IN CHAD SLOW VACCINATION PROGRESS IS AGGRAVATED BY SEVERAL CONTEXTUAL BARRIERS: the size of the country, the low population density, the nomadic nature of a significant part of its peoples, the recent civil war, associated with civil unrest and political instability and its geographical localization. In this situation it would be important to sustain downstream operations (the major focus of the ISS grant) while taking a long term view of the needs of the health system. The GAVI effectively supports downstream operations, but neglects the long term view.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.11604/pamj.2013.15.44.2006"

To estimate the fiscal impact of changes in morbidity and mortality attributed to rotavirus immunisation, we developed a government perspective model to estimate discounted net tax revenue for Ghana and Vietnam. The model derived the impact of rotavirus morbidity and mortality on lifetime productive capacity and related tax transfers, and demand for government transfers in relation to education and healthcare in immunised and non-immunised cohorts. The discounted age-specific net tax revenue was derived by deducting transfers from gross taxes and discounting for time preference. In Ghana, taking into account immunisation costs, tax and transfers, the estimated net discounted tax for the immunised cohort was estimated to generate $2.6 billion in net taxes up to age 65. In Vietnam, the net revenue attributed to the immunised cohort reached $55.17 billion suggesting an incremental benefit of approximately $29 million. We posit that the government perspective fiscal framework described here is a valid approach for estimating how governments benefit from investments in immunisation that can be considered supplementary to conventional cost-effectiveness approaches for defining value.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24055088"

Typhi) remains a serious burden of disease, especially in developing countries of Asia and Africa. It is estimated that it causes 200,000 deaths per year, mainly in children. S. Typhi is an obligate pathogen of humans and although it has a relatively complex life cycle with a long lived carrier state, the absence of non-human hosts suggests that well targeted control methods should have a major impact on disease. Newer control methods including new generations of vaccines offer hope but their implementation would benefit from quantitative models to guide the most cost effective strategies. This paper presents a quantitative model of Typhoid disease, immunity and transmission as a first step in that process.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A stochastic agent-based model has been developed that incorporates known features of the biology of typhoid including probability of infection, the consequences of infection, treatment options, acquisition and loss of immunity as a result of infection and vaccination, the development of the carrier state and the impact of environmental or behavioral factors on transmission. The model has been parameterized with values derived where possible from the literature and where this was not possible, feasible parameters space has been determined by sensitivity analyses, fitting the simulations to age distribution of field data. The model is able to adequately predict the age distribution of typhoid in two settings.SIGNIFICANCE: The modeling highlights the importance of variations in the exposure/resistance of infants and young children to infection in different settings, especially as this impacts on design of control programs; it predicts that naturally induced clinical and sterile immunity to typhoid is long lived and highlights the importance of the carrier state especially in areas of low transmission.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0074097"

Index to Theses, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI) Abstracts, Scopus, Article First, Academic Complete, Africa-Wide Information, Google Scholar, Global Health, British National Bibliography for Report Literature, and clinical trial registration websites were searched from inception to October 2009.REVIEW METHODS: Electronic databases searches, screening of identified studies, data extraction and analysis were undertaken. Meta-analysis was used to present numerical and graphical summaries of clinical efficacy and efficacy by time since vaccination. Evidence of heterogeneity was assessed using the tau-squared statistic. Meta-regression allowed the investigation of observed heterogeneity. Factors investigated included BCG strain, latitude, stringency of pre-BCG vaccination tuberculin testing, age at vaccination, site of disease, study design and vulnerability to biases. Rate of waning of protection was estimated using the ratio of the measure of efficacy after 10 years compared with the efficacy in the first 10 years of a study.RESULTS: Study selection. A total of 21,030 references were identified, providing data on 132 studies after abstract and full-text review. Efficacy. Protection against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults is variable, ranging from substantial protection in the UK MRC trial {rate ratio 0.22 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.31]}, to absence of clinically important benefit, as in the large Chingleput trial [rate ratio 1.05 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.25)] and greater in latitudes further away from the equator. BCG vaccination efficacy was usually high, and varied little by form of disease (with higher protection against meningeal and miliary tuberculosis) or study design when BCG vaccination was given only to infants or to children after strict screening for tuberculin sensitivity. High levels of protection against death were observed from both trials and observational studies. The observed protective effect of BCG vaccination did not differ by the strain of BCG vaccine used in trials.DURATION: Reviewed studies showed that BCG vaccination protects against pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis for up to 10 years. Most studies either did not follow up participants for long enough or had very few cases after 15 years. This should not be taken to indicate an absence of effect: five studies (one trial and four observational studies) provided evidence of measurable protection at least 15 years after vaccination. Efficacy declined with time. The rate of decline was variable, with faster decline in latitudes further from the equator and in situations where BCG vaccination was given to tuberculin-sensitive participants after stringent tuberculin testing.LIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this review relates to quality of included trials, most of which were conducted before current standards for reporting were formulated. In addition, data were lacking in some areas and the review had to rely on evidence from observational studies.CONCLUSIONS: BCG vaccination protection against tuberculosis varies between populations, to an extent that cannot be attributed to chance alone. Failure to exclude those already sensitised to mycobacteria and study latitude closer to the equator were associated with lower efficacy. These factors explained most of the observed variation. There is good evidence that BCG vaccination protection declines with time and that protection can last for up to 10 years. Data on protection beyond 15 years are limited; however, a small number of trials and observational studies suggest that BCG vaccination may protect for longer. Further studies are required to investigate the duration of protection by BCG vaccination.FUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.3310/hta17370"

This study evaluated the immunogenicity of seven-valent PCV (PCV7) administered at 6-weeks; 14-weeks and 9-months of age.METHODS: 250 healthy, HIV-unexposed infants were immunized with PCV7 concurrently with other childhood vaccines. Serotype-specific anti-capsular IgG concentrations were measured one-month following the 1(st) and 2(nd) PCV-doses, prior to and two-weeks following the 3(rd) dose. Opsonophagocytic killing assay (OPA) was measured for three serotypes following the 2(nd) and 3(rd) PCV7-doses. Immunogenicity of the current schedule was compared to a historical cohort of infants who received PCV7 at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age.RESULTS: The proportion of infants with serotype-specific antibody ≥ 0.35 µg/ml following the 2(nd) PCV7-dose ranged from 84% for 6B to ≥ 89% for other serotypes. Robust antibody responses were observed following the 3(rd) dose. The proportion of children with OPA ≥ 8 for serotypes 9V, 19F and 23F increased significantly following the 3(rd) PCV7-dose to 93.6%; 86.0% and 89.7% respectively. The quantitative antibody concentrations following the 2(nd) PCV7-dose were comparable to that after the 3(rd) -dose in the 6-10-14 week schedule. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) following the 3(rd) PCV7-dose were higher for all serotypes in this study compared to the historical cohort.CONCLUSIONS: The studied PCV7 dosing schedule induced good immune responses, including higher GMCs following the 3(rd-)dose at 9-months compared to when given at 14-weeks of age. This may confer longer persistence of antibodies and duration of protection against pneumococcal disease.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0072794"

This study evaluated costs and benefits of that portion of the health consultation associated with malaria prevention provided to US travelers bound for West Africa.METHODS: The estimated change in disease risk and associated costs and benefits resulting from traveler adherence to malaria chemoprophylaxis were calculated from 2 perspectives: the healthcare payer's and the traveler's. We used data from the Global TravEpiNet network of US travel clinics that collect de-identified pretravel data for international travelers. Disease risk and chemoprophylaxis effectiveness were estimated from published medical reports. Direct medical costs were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample and published literature.RESULTS: We analyzed 1029 records from January 2009 to January 2011. Assuming full adherence to chemoprophylaxis regimens, consultations saved healthcare payers a per-traveler average of $14 (9-day trip) to $372 (30-day trip). For travelers, consultations resulted in a range of net cost of $20 (9-day trip) to a net savings of $32 (30-day trip). Differences were mostly driven by risk of malaria in the destination country.CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that healthcare payers save money for short- and longer-term trips, and that travelers save money for longer trips when travelers adhere to malaria recommendations and prophylactic regimens in West Africa. This is a potential incentive to healthcare payers to offer consistent pretravel preventive care to travelers. This financial benefit complements the medical benefit of reducing the risk of malaria.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24014735"

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common etiologic agent of HCC in the world, particularly in areas prevalent for HBV infection such as Asia, Africa, southern part of Eastern and Central Europe, and the Middle East. Risk factors of HBV-related HCC include (1) viral factors-persistent high viral replication, HBV genotype C or D, pre-S2 or core promoter mutants; (2) host factors-older age (&gt;40 years old) at HBeAg seroconversion, male gender; (3) mother-to-infant transmission; and (4) other carcinogenic factors-smoking, habitual use of alcohol, etc. Prevention is the best way to control cancer. There are three levels of liver cancer prevention, i.e., primary prevention by HBV vaccination targeting the general population, secondary prevention by antiviral agent for high-risk subjects with chronic HBV infection, and tertiary prevention by antiviral agent to prevent recurrence for patients who have been successfully treated for liver cancer. Primary prevention by hepatitis B vaccination is most cost effective. Its cancer preventive efficacy supports it as the first successful example of cancer preventive vaccine in human. This experience can be extended to the development of other cancer preventive vaccine. Careful basic and clinical research is needed to develop ideal vaccines to induce adequate protection. Understanding the main transmission route and age at primary infection may help to set the optimal target age to start a new cancer preventive vaccination program. Besides timely HBV vaccination, the earlier administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin immediately after birth, and even antiviral agent during the third trimester of pregnancy to block mother-to-infant transmission of HBV are possible strategies to enhance the prevention efficacy of HBV infection and its related liver cancer.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/978-3-642-38965-8_5"

Although the economic burden of malaria in this region has been assessed previously, the extent and variation of this burden remains unclear. This study aimed to estimate the economic costs of malaria in U5 children in three countries (Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya).METHODS: Health system and household costs previously estimated were integrated with costs associated with co-morbidities, complications and productivity losses due to death. Several models were developed to estimate the expected treatment cost per episode per child, across different age groups, by level of severity and with or without controlling for treatment-seeking behaviour. Total annual costs (2009) were calculated by multiplying the treatment cost per episode according to severity by the number of episodes. Annual health system prevention costs were added to this estimate.RESULTS: Household and health system costs per malaria episode ranged from approximately US$ 5 for non-complicated malaria in Tanzania to US$ 288 for cerebral malaria with neurological sequelae in Kenya. On average, up to 55% of these costs in Ghana and Tanzania and 70% in Kenya were assumed by the household, and of these costs 46% in Ghana and 85% in Tanzania and Kenya were indirect costs. Expected values of potential future earnings (in thousands) lost due to premature death of children aged 0-1 and 1-4 years were US$ 11.8 and US$ 13.8 in Ghana, US$ 6.9 and US$ 8.1 in Tanzania, and US$ 7.6 and US$ 8.9 in Kenya, respectively. The expected treatment costs per episode per child ranged from a minimum of US$ 1.29 for children aged 2-11 months in Tanzania to a maximum of US$ 22.9 for children aged 0-24 months in Kenya. The total annual costs (in millions) were estimated at US$ 37.8, US$ 131.9 and US$ 109.0 nationwide in Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya and included average treatment costs per case of US$ 11.99, US$ 6.79 and US$ 20.54, respectively.CONCLUSION: This study provides important insight into the economic burden of malaria in SSA that may assist policy makers when designing future malaria control interventions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-2875-12-307"

They also require the mobilisation of a large health workforce. We assess the impact of the implementation of SIA campaigns on selected routine child and maternal health services in South Africa (SA).METHODS: We use district-level monthly headcount data for 52 South African districts for the period 2001-2010, sourced from the District Health Information System, SA. The data include 12 child and maternal health headcount indicators including routine immunisation, and maternal and reproductive health indicators. We analyse the association between the implementation of the 2010 SIA campaign and the change (decrease/increase) in headcounts, using a linear regression model.RESULTS: We find a significant decrease for eight indicators. The total number of fully immunised children before age 1 decreased by 29% (95% CI 23% to 35%, p&lt;0.001) during the month of SIA implementation; contraceptive use and antenatal visits decreased by 7-17% (p ≤ 0.02) and about 10% (p&lt;0.001), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: SIA campaigns may negatively impact health systems during the period of implementation by disrupting regular functioning and diverting resources from other activities, including routine child and maternal health services. SIA campaigns present multidimensional costs that need to be explicitly considered in benefit-cost assessments.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23975755"

Using simulations we examined incremental costs of VAZ relative to VA while varying stunting prevalence.SETTING: Data on efficacy and societal costs were largely from a South African trial. Secondary data were from local and international published sources.SUBJECTS: The trial included children aged 6-24 months. The secondary data sources were a South African health economics survey and the WHO-CHOICE (CHOosing Interventions that are Cost Effective) database.RESULTS: In the trial, stunted children supplemented with VAZ had 2·04 episodes (95 % CI 1·37, 3·05) of diarrhoea per child-year compared with 3·92 episodes (95 % CI 3·02, 5·09) in the VA arm. Average cost of illness was $Int 7·80 per episode (10th, 90th centile: $Int 0·28, $Int 15·63), assuming a minimum standard of care (oral rehydration and 14 d of therapeutic Zn). In simulation scenarios universal VAZ had low incremental costs or became cost-saving relative to VA when the prevalence of stunting was close to 20 %. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to the cost of intervention and coverage levels.CONCLUSIONS: This simulation suggests that universal VAZ would be cost-effective at current levels of stunting in parts of South Africa. This requires further validation under actual programmatic conditions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S1368980013002152"

HPV L1 virus-like particle (VLP) type-restricted vaccines prevent new infections and associated disease. However, their high cost has limited their application, and cytological screening programmes are still required to detect malignant lesions associated with the nonvaccine types. Thus, there is an urgent need for cheap second-generation HPV vaccines that protect against multiple types. The objective of this study was to express novel HPV-16 L1-based chimaeras, containing cross-protective epitopes from the L2 minor capsid protein, in tobacco plants. These L1/L2 chimaeras contained epitope sequences derived from HPV-16 L2 amino acid 108-120, 56-81 or 17-36 substituted into the C-terminal helix 4 (h4) region of L1 from amino acid 414. All chimaeras were expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana via an Agrobacterium-mediated transient system and targeted to chloroplasts. The chimaeras were highly expressed with yields of ~1.2 g/kg plant tissue; however, they assembled differently, indicating that the length and nature of the L2 epitope affect VLP assembly. The chimaera containing L2 amino acids 108-120 was the most successful candidate vaccine. It assembled into small VLPs and elicited anti-L1 and anti-L2 responses in mice, and antisera neutralized homologous HPV-16 and heterologous HPV-52 pseudovirions. The other chimaeras predominantly assembled into capsomeres and other aggregates and elicited weaker humoral immune responses, demonstrating the importance of VLP assembly for the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23924054"

Current studies of HIV prevalence and incidence are needed to determine potentially suitable cohorts for vaccine studies. The prevalence and incidence of HIV-1 infection among the police in Dar es Salaam in 1996 were 13.8% and 19.6/1000 PYAR respectively. This study aimed at determining the current prevalence and incidence of HIV in a police cohort 10 years after a similar study was conducted.METHODS: Police officers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania were prospectively enrolled into the study from 2005 and followed-up in an incidence study three years later. HIV infection was determined by two sequential enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in the prevalence study and discordant results between two ELISAs were resolved by a Western blot assay. Rapid HIV assays (SD Bioline and Determine) were used for the incidence study.RESULTS: A total of 1,240 police participated in the HIV prevalence study from August 2005 to November 2008. Of these, 1101 joined the study from August 2005-September 2007 and an additional 139 were recruited between October 2007 to November 2008 while conducting the incidence study. A total of 726 (70%) out of the 1043 eligible police participated in the incidence study.The overall HIV-1 prevalence was 65/1240 (5.2%). Females had a non-statistically significant higher prevalence of HIV infection compared to males 19/253, (7.5%) vs. 46/987 (4.7%) respectively (p=0.07). The overall incidence of HIV-1 was 8.4 per 1000 PYAR (95% CI 4.68-14.03), and by gender was 8.8 and 6.9 per 1000 PYAR, among males and females respectively, (p=0.82).CONCLUSIONS: The HIV prevalence and incidence among the studied police has declined over the past 10 years, and therefore this cohort is better suited for phase I/II HIV vaccine studies than for efficacy trials.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-13-722"

By contrast, BCG efficacy against pulmonary TB in children and adults is highly variable, ranging from 0% to 80%, though it tends to be higher in individuals who have no detectable prior exposure to mycobacterial infections, as judged by the absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity response (a negative tuberculin skin test, TST). The duration of protection against pulmonary TB is also variable, but lasts about 10 years on average. These observations raise the possibility that BCG revaccination, following primary vaccination in infancy, could be efficacious among TST-negative adolescents as they move into adulthood, the period of highest risk for pulmonary disease. To inform continuing debate about revaccination, this paper assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of revaccinating adolescents in a setting with intense transmission-Cape Town, South Africa. For a cost of revaccination in the range US$1-10 per person, and vaccine efficacy between 10% and 80% with protection for 10 years, the incremental cost per year of healthy life recovered (disability-adjusted life years, DALY) in the vaccinated population lies between US$116 and US$9237. The intervention is about twice as cost-effective when allowing for the extra benefits of preventing transmission, with costs per DALY recovered in the range US$52-$4540. At 80% efficacy, revaccination averted 17% of cases. Under the scenarios investigated, BCG revaccination is cost-effective against international benchmarks, though not highly effective. Cost-effectiveness ratios would be more favourable if we also allow for TB cases averted by preventing transmission to HIV-positive people, for the protection of HIV-negative people who later acquire HIV infection, for the possible non-specific benefits of BCG, for the fact that some adolescents would receive BCG for the first time, and for cost sharing when BCG is integrated into an adolescent immunization programme. These findings suggest, subject to further evaluation, that BCG revaccination could be cost-effective in some settings.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=rsif.2013.0365"

However there is little data about the burden of TB among adolescents. We estimated the prevalence and incidence of TB and assessed factors associated with TB among adolescents aged 12-18 years in a rural population in Uganda in order to prepare the site for phase III clinical trials with novel TB vaccines among adolescents.METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, we recruited 5000 adolescents and followed them actively, every 6 months, for 1-2 years. Participants suspected of having TB were those who had any of; TB signs and symptoms, history of TB contact or a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) of ≥10 mm. Laboratory investigations included sputum smear microscopy and culture.RESULTS: Of the 5000 participants, eight culture confirmed cases of TB were found at baseline: a prevalence of 160/100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI), 69-315). There were 13 incident TB cases detected in an average of 1.1 person years: an incidence of 235/100,000 person years (95% CI, 125-402). None of the confirmed TB cases were HIV infected. Predictors for prevalent TB disease were: a history of TB contact and a cough ≥ 2 weeks at baseline and being out of school, while the only predictor for incident TB was a positive TST during follow-up.CONCLUSION: The TB incidence among adolescents in this rural part of Uganda seemed too low for a phase III TB vaccine trial. However, the study site demonstrated capability to handle a large number of participants with minimal loss to follow-up and its suitability for future clinical trials. Improved contact tracing in TB program activities is likely to increase TB case detection among adolescents. Future studies should explore possible pockets of higher TB incidence in urban areas and among out of school youth.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2334-13-349"

The host of quantitative evidence documenting these changes has not been assembled at the global level. The purpose of this study is to estimate trends in the future number of newborns with SCA and the number of lives that could be saved in under-five children with SCA by the implementation of different levels of health interventions.METHODS AND FINDINGS: First, we calculated projected numbers of newborns with SCA for each 5-y interval between 2010 and 2050 by combining estimates of national SCA frequencies with projected demographic data. We then accounted for under-five mortality (U5m) projections and tested different levels of excess mortality for children with SCA, reflecting the benefits of implementing specific health interventions for under-five patients in 2015, to assess the number of lives that could be saved with appropriate health care services. The estimated number of newborns with SCA globally will increase from 305,800 (confidence interval [CI]: 238,400-398,800) in 2010 to 404,200 (CI: 242,500-657,600) in 2050. It is likely that Nigeria (2010: 91,000 newborns with SCA [CI: 77,900-106,100]; 2050: 140,800 [CI: 95,500-200,600]) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2010: 39,700 [CI: 32,600-48,800]; 2050: 44,700 [CI: 27,100-70,500]) will remain the countries most in need of policies for the prevention and management of SCA. We predict a decrease in the annual number of newborns with SCA in India (2010: 44,400 [CI: 33,700-59,100]; 2050: 33,900 [CI: 15,900-64,700]). The implementation of basic health interventions (e.g., prenatal diagnosis, penicillin prophylaxis, and vaccination) for SCA in 2015, leading to significant reductions in excess mortality among under-five children with SCA, could, by 2050, prolong the lives of 5,302,900 [CI: 3,174,800-6,699,100] newborns with SCA. Similarly, large-scale universal screening could save the lives of up to 9,806,000 (CI: 6,745,800-14,232,700) newborns with SCA globally, 85% (CI: 81%-88%) of whom will be born in sub-Saharan Africa. The study findings are limited by the uncertainty in the estimates and the assumptions around mortality reductions associated with interventions.CONCLUSIONS: Our quantitative approach confirms that the global burden of SCA is increasing, and highlights the need to develop specific national policies for appropriate public health planning, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Further empirical collaborative epidemiological studies are vital to assess current and future health care needs, especially in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and India.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001484"

About a third of these deaths occurred in India and Ethiopia. Public finance of rotavirus vaccination in these two countries could substantially decrease child mortality and also reduce rotavirus-related hospitalizations, prevent health-related impoverishment and bring significant cost savings to households.METHODS: We use a methodology of 'extended cost-effectiveness analysis' (ECEA) to evaluate a hypothetical publicly financed program for rotavirus vaccination in India and Ethiopia. We measure program impact along four dimensions: 1) rotavirus deaths averted; 2) household expenditures averted; 3) financial risk protection afforded; 4) distributional consequences across the wealth strata of the country populations.RESULTS: In India and Ethiopia, the program would lead to a substantial decrease in rotavirus deaths, mainly among the poorer; it would reduce household expenditures across all income groups and it would effectively provide financial risk protection, mostly concentrated among the poorest. Potential indirect benefits of vaccination (herd immunity) would increase program benefits among all income groups, whereas potentially decreased vaccine efficacy among poorer households would reduce the equity benefits of the program.CONCLUSIONS: Our approach incorporates financial risk protection and distributional consequences into the systematic economic evaluation of vaccine policy, illustrated here with the case study of public finance for rotavirus vaccination. This enables selection of vaccine packages based on the quantitative inclusion of information on equity and on how much financial risk protection is being bought per dollar expenditure on vaccine policy, in addition to how much health is being bought.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23871824"

Vaccination is highly efficacious for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of rabies in humans and animals, and prompt postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with vaccine and rabies immune globulin (RIG) can reliably prevent disease in humans. However, access to these tools and knowledge of their proper use are often limited, especially in impoverished, rabies-enzootic countries with the highest disease burden. In the absence of reliable diagnostic capacity and risk assessments, vaccines and RIG are often administered inappropriately, leading to chronic supply shortages and otherwise preventable deaths. Rather than focusing solely on human prophylaxis, it is more cost-effective over the long term to eliminate canine rabies in its natural terrestrial reservoirs. Because more than 99% of human rabies deaths result from dog bites, prevention efforts should focus on dogs. A versatile &quot;One Health&quot; strategy for canine rabies elimination should aim to create sustainable herd immunity in dogs, using proven vaccination strategies at the local level, coupled with community education and humane population management. Such strategies have succeeded in both developed and developing countries, and can be adapted to any locality. Numerous examples in Africa, Asia, and Latin America have shown that community-based, locally guided vaccination and education programs, based on a shared vision and long-term commitment, can eliminate canine rabies. Such programs should have specific goals and measurable outcomes, and should be conducted under the guidance of supportive governments, in collaboration with international partners and nongovernmental organizations. In addition to currently available tools, rabies prevention can be augmented by new dose-sparing human vaccine schedules, alternative routes of vaccine administration, monoclonal antibodies as an alternative to RIG, sensitive and specific point-of-care diagnostics and the development of canine immunocontraceptive methods.

The present study evaluated the impact of AI vaccination in terms of cumulative annual flock immunity (CAFI): the percentage of bird × weeks protected by immunity. This evaluation took account of the combined effects of vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacy (VE), and different characteristics of household poultry production on the effectiveness of the adopted vaccination strategy (VS), and provided alternative options for improvement. The evaluation used a population and vaccination model that calculates the CAFI. Participatory approaches were employed in 21 villages to develop the vaccination and flock parameters required for the model. The adopted VS were compared in the model with three alternative VS scenarios in terms of the CAFI. Vaccination coverage varied among villages but was generally low (between 1 and 48 %; median 14 %). Under the adopted VS, the CAFI predicted for the villages ranged from 2 to 31 %. It was concluded that despite the enormous effort put into rural household poultry AI vaccination by the Egyptian government, village CAFI is unlikely to be maintained at the levels required to significantly reduce the virus load and restrict transmission. In HPAI-endemic countries that consider AI vaccination as one of the disease control options, the high cost of mass AI vaccination campaigns and their achievable benefits must be compared with other available control measures, which may include targeted vaccination. Achievable vaccination coverage, VE and the different characteristics of commercial and household (village) poultry production are key parameters determining the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of different AI vaccination strategies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s11250-013-0446-8"

In many Balkan and Mediterranean countries, the disease burden due to viral hepatitis remains largely unrecognized, including in high-risk groups and migrants, because of a lack of reliable epidemiological data, suggesting the need for better and targeted surveillance for public health gains. In many countries, the burden of chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B and C is increasing due to ageing of unvaccinated populations and migration, and a probable increase in drug injecting. Targeted vaccination strategies for hepatitis B virus (HBV) among risk groups and harm reduction interventions at adequate scale and coverage for injecting drug users are needed. Transmission of HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in healthcare settings and a higher prevalence of HBV and HCV among recipients of blood and blood products in the Balkan and North African countries highlight the need to implement and monitor universal precautions in these settings and use voluntary, nonremunerated, repeat donors. Progress in drug discovery has improved outcomes of treatment for both HBV and HCV, although access is limited by the high costs of these drugs and resources available for health care. Egypt, with the highest burden of hepatitis C in the world, provides treatment through its National Control Strategy. Addressing the burden of viral hepatitis in the Balkan and Mediterranean regions will require national commitments in the form of strategic plans, financial and human resources, normative guidance and technical support from regional agencies and research.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1111/jvh.12120"

Understanding how to define and measure quality in the different key World Health Organization building blocks is critical to providing the information needed to address gaps and identify models for replication.DESCRIPTION OF APPROACHES: We describe the approaches to defining and improving quality across the five country programs funded through the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation African Health Initiative. While each program has independently developed and implemented country-specific approaches to strengthening health systems, they all included quality of services and systems as a core principle. We describe the differences and similarities across the programs in defining and improving quality as an embedded process essential for HSS to achieve the goal of improved population health. The programs measured quality across most or all of the six WHO building blocks, with specific areas of overlap in improving quality falling into four main categories: 1) defining and measuring quality; 2) ensuring data quality, and building capacity for data use for decision making and response to quality measurements; 3) strengthened supportive supervision and/or mentoring; and 4) operational research to understand the factors associated with observed variation in quality.CONCLUSIONS: Learning the value and challenges of these approaches to measuring and improving quality across the key components of HSS as the projects continue their work will help inform similar efforts both now and in the future to ensure quality across the critical components of a health system and the impact on population health.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1472-6963-13-S2-S8"

CPAs are likely to be immunogenic in infants and could confer serotype-independent protection. There are limited data on natural antibody kinetics against CPAs in African populations. We aimed to determine the prevalence of naturally acquired antibody titres to 15 CPAs and explore their association to concurrent pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in children aged 4-7 years with and without underlying HIV-infection and/or previous PCV-vaccination. A 15-plex Luminex assay was established to measure serum IgG titres against &quot;cell-wall associated or surface-exposed&quot; proteins (PspA, PspC, LytB, IgA1-proteinase, SP0082, PdB and PcsB), &quot;membrane-associated&quot; proteins (PsaA, SP0609, SP0749, PpmA, SlrA, StkP and SP2194) as well as the hypothetical protein, SP2027. Archived serum samples from HIV-uninfected (n=212) and HIV-infected (n=74) children were analyzed. Concurrent pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization was determined with standard microbiological methods. HIV-uninfected children had significantly higher antibody titres against PspA, PspC, PdB, SP0082, LytB, IgA1 proteinase and PcsB compared to HIV-infected children. In contrast, antibody titres against membrane associated proteins (PsaA, SP2027, PpmA and SlrA) were significantly lower in HIV-uninfected compared to HIV-infected children. Higher antibody titres against PdB, and PcsB were associated with the absence of pneumococcal colonization. There was no association between anti-CPA titres and PCV vaccination. In conclusion PdB and PcsB antigens are potential vaccine-candidates which may protect against pneumococcal colonization and consequently pneumococcal disease.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23845819"

We estimated the cost-effectiveness of introducing either PCV10 or the 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) from a societal perspective and explored the incremental impact of including indirect vaccine effects.METHODS: The costs and effects of pneumococcal vaccination among infants born in Kenya in 2010 were assessed using a decision analytic model comparing PCV10 or PCV13, in turn, with no vaccination. Direct vaccine effects were estimated as a reduction in the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis, sepsis, bacteraemic pneumonia and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. Pneumococcal disease incidence was extrapolated from a population-based hospital surveillance system in Kilifi and adjustments were made for variable access to care across Kenya. We used vaccine efficacy estimates from a trial in The Gambia and accounted for serotype distribution in Kilifi. We estimated indirect vaccine protection and serotype replacement by extrapolating from the USA. Multivariable sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. We assumed a vaccine price of US$ 3.50 per dose.FINDINGS: The annual cost of delivering PCV10 was approximately US$14 million. We projected a 42.7% reduction in pneumococcal disease episodes leading to a US$1.97 million reduction in treatment costs and a 6.1% reduction in childhood mortality annually. In the base case analysis, costs per discounted DALY and per death averted by PCV10, amounted to US$ 59 (95% CI 26-103) and US$ 1,958 (95% CI 866-3,425), respectively. PCV13 introduction improved the cost-effectiveness ratios by approximately 20% and inclusion of indirect effects improved cost-effectiveness ratios by 43-56%. The break-even prices for introduction of PCV10 and PCV13 are US$ 0.41 and 0.51, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Introducing either PCV10 or PCV13 in Kenya is highly cost-effective from a societal perspective. Indirect effects, if they occur, would significantly improve the cost-effectiveness.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0067324"

Mathematical model-based estimates of the potential demand, public health impact, and cost and financing requirements can be used to inform investment and adoption decisions by vaccine developers and policymakers on the use of malaria vaccines as complements to existing interventions. However, the complexity of such models may make their outputs inaccessible to non-modeling specialists. This paper describes a Malaria Vaccine Model (MVM) developed to address the specific needs of developers and policymakers, who need to access sophisticated modeling results and to test various scenarios in a user-friendly interface. The model's functionality is demonstrated through a hypothetical vaccine.METHODS: The MVM has three modules: supply and demand forecast; public health impact; and implementation cost and financing requirements. These modules include pre-entered reference data and also allow for user-defined inputs. The model includes an integrated sensitivity analysis function. Model functionality was demonstrated by estimating the public health impact of a hypothetical pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine with 85% efficacy against uncomplicated disease and a vaccine efficacy decay rate of four years, based on internationally-established targets. Demand for this hypothetical vaccine was estimated based on historical vaccine implementation rates for routine infant immunization in 40 African countries over a 10-year period. Assumed purchase price was $5 per dose and injection equipment and delivery costs were $0.40 per dose.RESULTS: The model projects the number of doses needed, uncomplicated and severe cases averted, deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and cost to avert each. In the demonstration scenario, based on a projected demand of 532 million doses, the MVM estimated that 150 million uncomplicated cases of malaria and 1.1 million deaths would be averted over 10 years. This is equivalent to 943 uncomplicated cases and 7 deaths averted per 1,000 vaccinees. In discounted 2011 US dollars, this represents $11 per uncomplicated case averted and $1,482 per death averted. If vaccine efficacy were reduced to 75%, the estimated uncomplicated cases and deaths averted over 10 years would decrease by 14% and 19%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The MVM can provide valuable information to assist decision-making by vaccine developers and policymakers, information which will be refined and strengthened as field studies progress allowing further validation of modeling assumptions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2334-13-295"

Estimates were generated for 4 country groups: countries eligible for funding by the GAVI Alliance in Africa and Asia, lower middle-income countries, and upper middle-income countries. Values, including disease incidence, case fatality rates, and treatment costs, were based on international country estimates and the scientific literature.RESULTS: From the societal perspective, it is estimated that the probability of Hib conjugate vaccine cost saving is 34%-53% in Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization eligible African and Asian countries, respectively. In middle-income countries, costs per discounted disability adjusted life year averted are between US$37 and US$733. Variation in vaccine prices and risks of meningitis sequelae and mortality explain most of the difference in results. For all country groups, disease incidence cause the largest part of the uncertainty in the result.CONCLUSIONS: Hib conjugate vaccine is cost saving or highly cost-effective in low- and middle-income settings. This conclusion is especially influenced by the recent decline in Hib conjugate vaccine prices and new data revealing the high costs of lost productivity associated with meningitis sequelae.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0022-3476(13)00307-7"

It causes significant economic losses due to high mortality and the high cost of antibiotic treatment of affected animals, limiting herd productivity. It is present in sub-Saharan Africa, islands in the Indian Ocean and two Caribbean islands (Guadeloupe and Antigua) from where it threatens the American mainland due to risk of the spread of infected A. variegatum by migratory birds or by uncontrolled movement of animals. If an accidental introduction of a tick-free ER carrier animal occurs, autochthonous A. maculatum has proven to be a good experimental vector for heartwater. Modeling A. variegatum population dynamics has been developed, but further work is needed to predict favourable habitats and allow targeted surveillance. We overview here the advances in diagnostics, vaccines and epidemiology of heartwater and analyze the research gaps and needs to mitigate potential ER introduction and spread on the American mainland. Effective serologic ELISA tests allow prevalence studies, and several PCR-based diagnostic tests are currently available to detect ER in sick animals. However, the development of rapid assays, including multi-pathogen tests, would enhance the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of heartwater diagnosis. Several experimental vaccines (inactivated, attenuated and recombinant) are under development. Attenuated and inactivated vaccines are effective against homologous strains but their efficacy in the field is decreased due to broad antigenic diversity of ER. New molecular typing assays are now being used to study the genetic structure of ER populations worldwide, but the linking of genotyping to cross-protection is still not straightforward. Currently an inactivated vaccine would be the most appropriate vaccine for the American mainland due to its safety, the availability of a fully controlled bioprocess allowing ER mass production and the possibility to design &quot;regional cocktail vaccines&quot;. This would require the selection and isolation of Caribbean ER strains supported by data of molecular epidemiology studies in this region. Development of an universal recombinant vaccine requires increased knowledge of ERbiology, including virulence mechanisms. Comparison of virulent and attenuated strains using&quot;omic approaches&quot; is on-going and will be crucial to understand these mechanisms and to develop improved vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=000190050"

We designed the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) to identify the aetiology and population-based burden of paediatric diarrhoeal disease in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.METHODS: The GEMS is a 3-year, prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children aged 0-59 months residing in censused populations at four sites in Africa and three in Asia. We recruited children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea seeking care at health centres along with one to three randomly selected matched community control children without diarrhoea. From patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and controls, we obtained clinical and epidemiological data, anthropometric measurements, and a faecal sample to identify enteropathogens at enrolment; one follow-up home visit was made about 60 days later to ascertain vital status, clinical outcome, and interval growth.FINDINGS: We enrolled 9439 children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and 13,129 control children without diarrhoea. By analysing adjusted population attributable fractions, most attributable cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea were due to four pathogens: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin (ST-ETEC; with or without co-expression of heat-labile enterotoxin), and Shigella. Other pathogens were important in selected sites (eg, Aeromonas, Vibrio cholerae O1, Campylobacter jejuni). Odds of dying during follow-up were 8·5-fold higher in patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea than in controls (odd ratio 8·5, 95% CI 5·8-12·5, p&lt;0·0001); most deaths (167 [87·9%]) occurred during the first 2 years of life. Pathogens associated with increased risk of case death were ST-ETEC (hazard ratio [HR] 1·9; 0·99-3·5) and typical enteropathogenic E coli (HR 2·6; 1·6-4·1) in infants aged 0-11 months, and Cryptosporidium (HR 2·3; 1·3-4·3) in toddlers aged 12-23 months.INTERPRETATION: Interventions targeting five pathogens (rotavirus, Shigella, ST-ETEC, Cryptosporidium, typical enteropathogenic E coli) can substantially reduce the burden of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea.

Typhi) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Africa. With limited anticipated short-term improvements in sanitation and water infrastructure, targeted vaccination campaigns may be an important prevention tool for typhoid fever.METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 435 randomly selected households in four rural villages on Pemba Island, Tanzania. A dichotomous 'readiness to pay' variable was created to assess vaccine desirability. Data analyses included univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Bivariate outcomes (ANOVA, t-tests, and chi-square) and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals are reported.RESULTS: A total of 66% respondents stated that they would pay for a typhoid fever vaccine in the future. Readiness to pay was not significantly associated with household expenditures. Readiness to pay was associated with use of local Primary Health Care Units (PHCUs) compared to use of cottage or district hospitals (OR 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.7]: p=.007) and with knowledge of someone being sick from typhoid fever (OR 2.2 [95% CI, 1.0-4.5]: p=.039). Respondents perceiving prevention measures as more effective (OR 1.0 [95% CI, 1.0-1.2]: p=.009) were also more likely ready to pay. Preferred methods of communication of information about a typhoid fever vaccine included broadcasting via microphone ('miking'), radio, and door-to-door visits.CONCLUSIONS: With rapid increase in numbers of licensed and promising vaccines, policy makers and health administrators are faced with decisions regarding allocation of scarce health resources for competing interventions. Community residents need to be informed about diseases which may not be readily recognized, diagnosed, and treated. Perceived vulnerability to the disease may increase likelihood of vaccine desirability. A better local understanding of typhoid fever is needed for general prevention measures, increasing treatment access, and future vaccination campaigns.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(13)00527-6"

A process of exploring options for a continuous or &quot;Keep-Up&quot; distribution system was initiated in early 2011. This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive national process to review the major considerations, findings and recommendations for the implementation of a new strategy.METHODS: Stakeholder meetings and site visits were conducted in five locations in Tanzania to garner stakeholder input on the proposed distribution systems. Coverage levels for LLINs and their decline over time were modelled using NetCALC software, taking realistic net decay rates, current demographic profiles and other relevant parameters into consideration. Costs of the different distribution systems were estimated using local data.RESULTS: LLIN delivery was considered via mass campaigns, Antenatal Care-Expanded Programme on Immunization (ANC/EPI), community-based distribution, schools, the commercial sector and different combinations of the above. Most approaches appeared unlikely to maintain universal coverage when used alone. Mass campaigns, even when combined with a continuation of the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme (TNVS), would produce large temporal fluctuations in coverage levels; over 10 years this strategy would require 63.3 million LLINs and a total cost of $444 million USD. Community mechanisms, while able to deliver the required numbers of LLINs, would require a massive scale-up in monitoring, evaluation and supervision systems to ensure accurate application of identification criteria at the community level. School-based approaches combined with the existing TNVS would reach most Tanzanian households and deliver 65.4 million LLINs over 10 years at a total cost of $449 million USD and ensure continuous coverage. The cost of each strategy was largely driven by the number of LLINs delivered.CONCLUSIONS: The most cost-efficient strategy to maintain universal coverage is one that best optimizes the numbers of LLINs needed over time. A school-based approach using vouchers targeting all students in Standards 1, 3, 5, 7 and Forms 1 and 2 in combination with the TNVS appears to meet best the criteria of effectiveness, equity and efficiency.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-2875-12-150"

The surveys aimed to estimate the proportion of children with MSD who would present to sentinel health centers (SHCs) where GEMS case recruitment would occur and provide a basis for adjusting disease incidence rates to include cases not seen at the SHCs. The proportion of children at each site reported to have had an incident episode of MSD during the 7 days preceding the survey ranged from 0.7% to 4.4% for infants (0-11 months of age), from 0.4% to 4.7% for toddlers (12-23 months of age), and from 0.3% to 2.4% for preschoolers (24-59 months of age). The proportion of MSD episodes at each site taken to an SHC within 7 days of diarrhea onset was 15-56%, 17-64%, and 7-33% in the three age strata, respectively. High cost of care and insufficient knowledge about danger signs were associated with lack of any care-seeking outside the home. Most children were not offered recommended fluids and continuing feeds at home. We have shown the utility of serial HUASs as a tool for optimizing operational and methodological issues related to the performance of a large case-control study and deriving population-based incidence rates of MSD. Moreover, the surveys suggest key targets for educational interventions that might improve the outcome of diarrheal diseases in low-resource settings.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=ajtmh.12-0749"

The WHO Health System Framework of building blocks was used to organize the analysis of these data to assess potential areas of impact of NVI on health systems. In April 2012, the Ad-hoc Working Group presented its findings to SAGE. While reductions in disease burden and improvements in disease and adverse events surveillance, training, cold chain and logistics capacity and injection safety were commonly documented as beneficial impacts, opportunities for strengthening the broader health system were consistently missed during NVI. Weaknesses in planning for human and financial resource needs were highlighted as a concern. Where positive impacts on health systems following NVI occurred, these were often in areas where detailed technical guidance or tools and adequate financing were available. SAGE supported the Ad-hoc Working Group's conclusion that future NVI should explicitly plan to optimize and document the impact of NVI on broader health systems. Furthermore, opportunities for improving integration of delivery of immunization services, commodities, and messages with other parts of the health system should be actively sought with the recognition that integration is a bidirectional process. To avoid the gaps in planning for NVI that can compromise existing immunization and health systems, donors and partners should provide sufficient and timely support to facilitate country planning. Areas for future research were also identified. Finally, to support countries in using NVI as an opportunity to strengthen immunization and health systems, the WHO guidance for countries on new vaccine introduction is being updated to reflect ways this might be accomplished.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(12)01592-7"

Without postexposure prophylaxis, almost all cases are fatal, making rabies the most lethal infectious disease. Tens of thousands of deaths are reported annually, but the official figures are believed to be gross underestimates. Controlling canine rabies, especially in free-ranging dogs, is the first priority to reduce the burden of human disease. Because of their limited medical infrastructure, most endemic countries lack the laboratory facilities needed to diagnose human cases of viral encephalitis. Moreover, the veterinary sectors are often unable to undertake systematic surveillance and reporting of rabies in animals. Without an adequate and functioning risk assessment system that is primed for use, rabies will remain a 'neglected' and omnipresent disease, especially in poverty-stricken regions of the world. Fortunately, experience with the elimination of canine rabies from many industrialized countries has shown that these barriers are not insurmountable. Successful rabies prevention and control strategies that prove the absence of the disease depend on laboratory-based surveillance, rapid data reporting and an adequate system of risk assessment. Future control and prevention programmes should therefore coordinate the development of these key factors, creating synergies to eliminate rabies at its animal source.

Different scenarios explored various accompanying shipping policies and frequencies.FINDINGS: Removing the regional level and implementing a collection-based shipping policy from the district stores increases vaccine availability from a mean of 70-100% when districts could collect vaccines at least weekly. Alternatively, implementing a delivery-based shipping policy from the central store monthly in three-route and eight-route scenarios only increases vaccine availability to 87%. Restricting central-to district vaccine shipments to a quarterly schedule for three-route and eight-route scenarios reduces vaccine availability to 49%. The collection-based shipping policy from district stores reduces supply chain logistics cost per dose administered from US$0.14 at baseline to US$0.13 after removing the regional level.CONCLUSION: Removing the regional level from Niger's vaccine supply chain can substantially improve vaccine availability as long as certain concomitant adjustments to shipping policies and frequencies are implemented.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(13)00430-1"

To improve recommendations for travelers, we assessed the global availability of rabies vaccine (RV) and rabies immune globulin (RIG).METHODS: We conducted a 20-question online survey, in English, Spanish, and French, distributed via e-mail to travel medicine providers and other clinicians worldwide from February 1 to March 30, 2011. Results were compiled according to the region.RESULTS: Among total respondents, only 190 indicated that they provided traveler postexposure care. Most responses came from North America (38%), Western Europe (19%), Australia and South and West Pacific Islands (11%), East and Southeast Asia (8%), and Southern Africa (6%). Approximately one third of 187 respondents stated that patients presented with wounds from an animal exposure that were seldom or never adequately cleansed. RIG was often or always accessible for 100% (n = 5) of respondents in the Middle East and North Africa; 94% (n = 17) in Australia and South and West Pacific Islands; 20% (n = 1) in Tropical South America; and 56% (n = 5) in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia.

All travelers should be informed that RIG and RV might not be readily available at their destination and that travel health and medical evacuation insurance should be considered prior to departure. Travelers should be educated to avoid animal exposures; to clean all animal bites, licks, and scratches thoroughly with soap and water; and to seek medical care immediately, even if overseas.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1111/jtm.12024"

These efforts include regular rounds of immunization days and routine exercises. The government of Nigeria periodically undertakes National Demographic and Health (NDH) surveys, which tap information on various health indices including vaccination coverage. Limited studies have used the NDHS data to examine the trends in vaccination coverage for the assessment of successes or failures of the immunization efforts.METHODS: This study used four NDH Surveys datasets between 1990 and 2008, which generated child health information including the proportion that had had any or all basic childhood vaccines. A combined total of 44,071 (weighted) children were involved in the study. The trend and pattern of vaccination over 18 years were examined while selected factors were regressed to obtain predictors of child vaccinations in Nigeria.RESULTS: The most recent survey (2008) reported more complete vaccination apart from 1990, which was said to be inaccurate. In all surveys, children from mothers with higher education, who were delivered in hospitals, lived in urban areas, and whose mothers work outside the home had significantly higher proportions of completed basic vaccination. A lower level of childhood vaccination is observed in the northern parts, while higher rates are observed in the southern parts. More complete vaccination coverage was reported in the 1990 survey, followed by 2008, 1999 and 2003. In addition, children from mothers with higher levels of education, who were delivered in hospitals, who lived in urban areas, and whose mothers work outside the home had significantly higher proportions of completed basic vaccination.CONCLUSION: Much more work needs to be done if more children are to be covered and thus reduce vaccine-preventable diseases.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23573874"

According to our ad hoc adapted dynamic model of HPV infection transmission, the addition of catch-up was estimated to bring forward the 50% reduction of HPV16/18 prevalence due to vaccination in women ≤35 by as much as 5 years. Catch-up of 12- to 15-year olds reduced the cumulative probability of HPV16/18 infections by age 35 in the relevant cohorts by about 30% in both countries. Catch-up of 16- to 19-year-old girls added little. Regardless of the chosen catch-up strategy, 16 to 20% of HPV16/18 prevention from vaccination was attributable to herd immunity. Assuming a sufficiently low vaccine cost, the addition of a catch-up round is, therefore, worth considering in medium/low-income countries to extend vaccine benefits to less young adolescent girls whose future access to cervical screening is uncertain.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23564420"

Eliminating canine rabies throughout the world would save thousands of lives and would reduce the economic impact of the disease by dramatically reducing the requirement for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Lengthy experience in the industrialized countries and ongoing programs in Latin America, Africa, and Asia have shown that the elimination of rabies in dogs is an achievable goal. The presence of canine rabies in developing countries is associated with poverty, and most deaths occur in the lowest socioeconomic sectors. To be successful, national rabies control programs should share responsibility with local communities for prevention and control activities and maintaining disease-free status. Legislation should be adapted to local conditions and the realities of dog ownership. While the provision of PEP to all bite victims is affordable in many countries, it is usually beyond the capacity of impoverished nations, which deal with many other health priorities. Ministries of health should provide PEP, either free or with a charge preferably at a subsidized price, replacing the current system in many countries, in which biologics are sold by government-owned and private clinics at a cost beyond the means of bite victims. The public health sector should assume responsibility when animal control strategies are not effectively implemented or when PEP is not administered correctly or is not available. A global strategy is needed to identify gaps in surveillance and diagnosis, improve access to PEP and enhance canine immunization and population management. Such approaches based on a &quot;One Health&quot; model should be coordinated across regions, and should extend control efforts to other dog-related zoonoses.

Human deaths are the most important direct economic impact of canine rabies, followed by livestock losses and the cost of PEP, while expenses associated with dog vaccination and control are major indirect impacts. The global burden of rabies disproportionately affects Asia, which experiences more than half of human rabies deaths and approximately 65% of livestock losses, and performs more than 90% of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Africa is second to Asia in terms of human deaths and livestock losses, but administers the least number of PEPs of the three regions.

We present the methods and results of the response campaign solely shouldered by the district and intermediate level. The risk group, targets and neighborhoods to be vaccinated were identified after a detailed analysis of initial cases. The intermediate level defined strategies, provided logistics, capacity building and 41% of the operational budget while 59% was completed by the peripheral level. Microsoft Office Excel 2007 was used to estimate coverage rates and to draw an epidemic curve. The response immunization campaign was organized on the 14th epidemiological week, 10 weeks after the onset of the outbreak which ended 11 weeks thereafter. A total of 15867(108.5%) children aged 9-59 months were vaccinated in five health areas at a direct cost (vaccines excluded) of 71.34FCFA ($0.143) per vaccinated child. An additional 824 children aged 9-59 months were vaccinated around the residence of notified cases in neighborhoods which were not involved in the response campaign. The number of cases after the response campaign was lower than before. Once vaccines are available, prompt outbreak response campaigns can be organized at operational level to obtain commendable results instead of depending solely on international organizations or central levels. Decision makers at the intermediate and operational levels should redeploy available funds during emergencies to prevent the development of extreme public health conditions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1756-0500-6-100"

Infection by HSV-2 is life-long and is associated with significant cost to healthcare systems and social stigma despite the highly prevalent nature of the disease. For instance, the proportion of HSV-2 seropositive to seronegative adults is approximately 1 in 5 in the US and greater than 4 in 5 in some areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The replication-defective vaccine strain virus dl5-29 was re-derived using cells appropriate for GMP manufacturing and renamed ACAM529. Immunization with dl5-29 was previously reported to be protective both in mice and in guinea pigs, however these studies were performed with vaccine that was purified using methods that cannot be scaled for manufacturing of clinical material. Here we describe methods which serve as a major step towards preparation of ACAM529 which may be suitable for testing in humans. ACAM529 can be harvested from infected cell culture of the trans-complementing cell line AV529 clone 19 (AV529-19) without mechanical cell disruption. ACAM529 may then be purified with respect to host cell DNA and proteins by a novel purification scheme, which includes a combination of endonuclease treatment, depth filtration, anion-exchange chromatography and ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF). The resultant virus retains infectivity and is ∼ 200-fold more pure with respect to host cell DNA and proteins than is ACAM529 purified by ultracentrifugation. Additionally, we describe a side-by-side comparison of chromatography-purified ACAM529 with sucrose cushion-purified ACAM529, which shows that both preparations are equally immunogenic and protective when tested in vivo.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0057224"

A conjoint analysis and ordered probit regression models were used to measure the preferences of farmers for CBPP vaccine and vaccination attributes. This was with regard to inclusion or not of an indicator in the vaccine, vaccine safety, vaccine stability as well as frequency of vaccination, vaccine administration and the nature of vaccination. The analysis was carried out in 190 households in Narok District of Kenya between October and December 2006 using structured questionnaires, 16 attribute profiles and a five-point Likert scale. The factors affecting attribute valuation were shown through a two-way location interaction model. The study also demonstrated the relative importance (RI) of attributes and the compensation value of attribute levels. The attribute coefficient estimates showed that farmers prefer a vaccine that has an indicator, is 100% safe and is administered by the government (p&lt;0.0001). The preferences for the vaccine attributes were consistent with expectations. Preferences for stability, frequency of vaccination and nature of vaccination differed amongst farmers (p&gt;0.05). While inclusion of an indicator in the vaccine was the most important attribute (RI=43.6%), price was the least important (RI=0.5%). Of the 22 household factors considered, 15 affected attribute valuation. The compensation values for a change from non inclusion to inclusion of an indicator, 95-100% safety, 2h to greater than 2h stability and from compulsory to elective vaccination were positive while those for a change from annual to biannual vaccination and from government to private administration were negative. The study concluded that the farmers in Narok District had preferences for specific vaccine and vaccination attributes. These preferences were conditioned by various household characteristics and disease risk factors. On average the farmers would need to be compensated or persuaded to accept biannual and private vaccination against CBPP. There is need for consideration of farmer preferences for vaccine attribute levels during vaccine formulations and farmer preferences for vaccination attribute levels when designing delivery of vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0167-5877(13)00062-7"

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is the third largest recipient of GAVI funds in terms of cumulative disbursed support. We provided a comprehensive assessment of GAVI support and analysed trends in immunisation performance and financing in the DRC from 2002 to 2010.METHODS: The scope of the analysis includes GAVI's total financial support and the value of vaccines and syringes purchased by GAVI for the DRC from 2002 to 2010. Data were collected through a review of published and grey literature and interviews with key stakeholders in the DRC. We assessed the allocation and use of GAVI funds for each of GAVI's support areas, as well as trends in immunisation performance and financing.FINDINGS: DTP3 coverage increased from 2002 (38%) to 2007 (72%) but had decreased to a level below 70% in 2008 (68%) and 2010 (63%). The overall funding for vaccines increased from US$5.4 million in 2006 to US$30.5 million in 2010 (mostly from GAVI support for new vaccines). However, during the same period, the funding from national (government) and international (GAVI and other donors) sources for routine immunisation services (except vaccines) decreased from US$36.4 million to US$24.4 million. This drop in overall funding (33%) primarily affected surveillance, transport, and cold chain equipment.INTERPRETATION: GAVI support to DRC has enhanced significant progress in routine immunisation performance and financing during 2002-2010. Although progress has been partly sustained, the initial observed increase in DTP3 coverage and available funding for routine immunisation halted towards the end of the analysis period, coinciding with tetravalent and pentavalent vaccine introduction. These findings highlight the need for additional efforts to ensure the sustainability of routine immunization program performance and financing.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(13)00187-4"

We used province-level campaign data sourced from the District Health Information System, SA, and from planning records of provincial coordinators of the Expanded Programme on Immunization. The data included the number of children immunized with measles and polio vaccines, the number of children given vitamin A supplements and Albendazole tablets, and costs.RESULTS: The campaign cost $37 million and averted a total of 1,150 deaths (95% uncertainty range: 990-1,360). This ranged from 380 deaths averted in KwaZulu-Natal to 20 deaths averted in the Northern Cape. Vitamin A supplementation alone averted 820 deaths (95% UR: 670-1,040); measles vaccination alone averted 330 deaths (95% UR: 280-370). Incremental cost-effectiveness was $27,100 (95% UR: $18,500-34,400) per death averted nationally, ranging from $11,300 per death averted in the Free State to $91,300 per death averted in the Eastern Cape.CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of the SIA child health delivery platform varies substantially across SA provinces, and it is substantially more cost-effective when vitamin A supplementation is included in the interventions administered. Cost-effectiveness assessments should consider health system delivery platforms that integrate multiple interventions, and they should be conducted at the sub-national level.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20056"

The extent to which evidence-based modalities can be combined to prevent substantial HIV transmission is largely unknown, but combination approaches that are truly implementable in field conditions are likely to be far more effective than single interventions alone. Analogous to PMTCT, &quot;treatment as prevention&quot; for adult-to-adult transmission reduction includes expanded HIV testing, linkage to care, antiretroviral coverage, retention in care, adherence to therapy, and management of key co-morbidities such as depression and substance use. With successful viral suppression, persons with HIV are far less infectious to others, as we see in the fields of sexually transmitted infection control and mycobacterial disease control (tuberculosis and leprosy). Combination approaches are complex, may involve high program costs, and require substantial global commitments.

We investigated the effects of unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) on birth registration, vaccination uptake, and school attendance in children in Zimbabwe.METHODS: We did a matched, cluster-randomised controlled trial in ten sites in Manicaland, Zimbabwe. We divided each study site into three clusters. After a baseline survey between July, and September, 2009, clusters in each site were randomly assigned to UCT, CCT, or control, by drawing of lots from a hat. Eligible households contained children younger than 18 years and satisfied at least one other criteria: head of household was younger than 18 years; household cared for at least one orphan younger than 18 years, a disabled person, or an individual who was chronically ill; or household was in poorest wealth quintile. Between January, 2010, and January, 2011, households in UCT clusters collected payments every 2 months. Households in CCT clusters could receive the same amount but were monitored for compliance with several conditions related to child wellbeing. Eligible households in all clusters, including control clusters, had access to parenting skills classes and received maize seed and fertiliser in December, 2009, and August, 2010. Households and individuals delivering the intervention were not masked, but data analysts were.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that there were 216 million cases of malaria in 2010, and ~655,000 people died from the disease (~2000 per day), many under age five. Yet the disease, a killer for centuries, remains endemic in many poor nations, particularly in Africa, where it is blamed for retarding economic growth. India contributes ~70% of the 2.5 million reported cases in Southeast Asia. Malaria is also an important threat to travelers to the tropics, causing thousands of cases of illness and occasional deaths. The 5 Plasmodium species known to cause malaria are P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. Most cases of malaria are uncomplicated, but some can quickly turn into severe, often fatal, episodes in vulnerable individuals if not promptly diagnosed and effectively treated. Malaria vaccines have been an area of intensive research, but there is no effective vaccine. Vaccines are among the most cost-effective tools for public health; they have historically contributed to a reduction in the spread and burden of infectious diseases. Many antigens present throughout the parasite life cycle that could be vaccine targets. More than 30 of these are being researched by teams worldwide in the hope of identifying a combination that can elicit protective immunity. Most vaccine research has focused on the P. falciparum strain due to its high mortality and the ease of conducting in vitro and in vivo studies. DNA-based vaccines are a new technology that may hold hope for an effective malaria vaccine.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23403452"

There were moderately low levels of knowledge about HPV infection and prevention of cervical cancer, but a moderately high level of knowledge about HPV vaccine. Although 90.8% acknowledged that cervical cancer is directly linked to HPV infection, nearly 32% failed to identify it as a sexually transmitted infection (STI), while 43.4% believed it is an uncommon infection. Willingness to recommend the HPV vaccine was moderate, with 69.7% intentionally initiating discussions with patients about the subject. The most important factors considered when deciding to recommend the vaccine included effectiveness (56.6%) and side effects/safety (11.8%).

In addition, the economic burden is important for policy formulation. The aim of this study is to estimate patient side cost and to determine predictors of its variation for the treatment of cervical cancer.METHODS: Analytic cross sectional study involving 227 cervical cancer cases at Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Ethiopia was conducted. Cost estimation was based on patients' perspective and using the prevalence-based model as a time frame. Productivity losses were estimated from lost working days.RESULTS: The mean outpatient cost per patient for cervical cancer was $407.2 (Median = $206.9). Direct outpatient cost (Mean = $334.2) takes the largest share compared with the indirect counterpart ($150). The outpatient cost for half of the respondent falls in a range between $93.7 and $478. The mean inpatient cost for hospitalized patients was $404.4. The average direct inpatient cost was $329 (74% medical costs and 26% non medical costs).

Further research and development is also becoming increasingly crucial. Among other needs, common methodologies for estimating and tracking the malaria burden, new strategies to measure transmission, better understanding of immunity, and increased knowledge of the mechanisms and effects of resistance to drugs and insecticides stand out. The ongoing efforts in research and development for new antimalarial drugs, more sensitive point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests and new insecticides need further innovation and substantial strengthening.

Ten HEIs had a policy consisting mainly of recommendations given to students at registration. Nine HEIs made HB vaccinations available, with four HEIs covering the cost through student fees. Seven HEIs did not require a record of previous vaccination. Six HEIs did not accept non-responders (NRs), three HEIs would only accept an NR after receiving a second three-dose vaccination series and counselling, six HEIs regarded an HBV carrier as infectious, and 10 HEIs would accept HBV carriers as students. The low response rate makes it difficult to generalize the results, but may suggest a lack of an HB vaccination policy for student HCWs at non-responding HEIs.CONCLUSIONS: Policies of responding HEIs regarding HB vaccination, HBV carriage and response to HB vaccination were variable, sometimes inappropriate and not sufficiently comprehensive to protect student HCWs against occupationally acquired HBV.

In recent years, molecular tests that can detect and characterise pathogens in a diverse range of sample types have revolutionised laboratory diagnostics. In addition to use in centralised laboratories, there are opportunities to locate diagnostic technologies close to the animals with suspected clinical signs. Work in this area has developed simple-to-use lateral-flow devices for the detection of FMD virus (FMDV), as well as new hardware platforms to allow molecular testing to be deployed into the field for use by non-specialists. Once FMDV has been detected, nucleotide sequencing is used to compare field strains with reference viruses. Transboundary movements of FMDV are routinely monitored using VP1 sequence data, while higher resolution transmission trees (at the farm-to-farm level) can be reconstructed using full-genome sequencing approaches. New technologies such as next-generation sequencing technologies are now being applied to dissect the viral sequence populations that exist within single samples. The driving force for the use of these technologies has largely been influenced by the priorities of developed countries with FMD-free (without vaccination) status. However, it is important to recognise that these approaches also show considerable promise for use in countries where FMD is endemic, although further modifications (such as sample archiving and strain and serotype characterisation) may be required to tailor these tests for use in these regions. Access to these new diagnostic and sequencing technologies in sub-Saharan Africa have the potential to provide novel insights into FMD epidemiology and will impact upon improved strategies for disease control.Effective control of infectious diseases is reliant upon accurate diagnosis of clinical cases using laboratory tests, together with an understanding of factors that impact upon the epidemiology of the infectious agent. A wide range of new diagnostic tools and nucleotide sequencing methods are used by international reference laboratories to detect and characterise the agents causing outbreaks of infectious diseases. In the past, high costs (initial capital expenses, as well as day-to-day maintenance and running costs) and complexity of the protocols used to perform some of these tests have limited the use of these methods in smaller laboratories. However, simpler and more cost-effective formats are now being developed that offer the prospect that these technologies will be even more widely deployed into laboratories particularly those in developing regions of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=23327376"

Phylogenetic and genetic analyses of the glycoproteins were established for some strains.RESULTS: Out of the 800 chicken and turkey flocks tested by cELISA, 223 showed positive anti-NP antibodies (28.7%, 95% CI: 25.6-32.1). Significantly higher seroprevalence was found among the coastal areas compared to inland and during the autumn and winter. Broiler flocks showed significantly lower seroprevalence than layers and broiler breeders. The influenza virus infection prevalence increased after the laying phase among layer flocks. In addition, AIV seropositivity was significantly associated with low biosecurity measures. The Ag EIA and rRT-PCR tests revealed significantly higher numbers of AI positive samples as compared to cell cultures or egg inoculation. All new strains were subtyped as H9N2 by real time and conventional RT-PCR. Drift mutations, addition or deletion of glycosylation sites were likely to have occurred in the HA and NA glycoproteins of Tunisian strains resulting in multiple new amino acid substitutions. This fact may reflect different evolutionary pressures affecting these glycoproteins. The role of these newly detected substitutions should be tested.CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the potential risk of AIV to avian health. Strict enforcement of biosecurity measures and possible vaccination of all poultry flocks with continuous monitoring of poultry stations may ensure reduction of AIV prevalence and avoid emergence of more pathogenic strains.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0053524"

There is a single serotype of PPR virus, but four distinct genetic lineages. Morbidity and mortality are high when occurring in naive sheep and goats populations. Cattle and African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) are asymptomatically infected. Other wild ruminants and camels may express clinical signs and mortality. PPR has recently spread in southern and northern Africa, and in central and far-east Asia. More than one billion sheep and goats worldwide are at risk. PPR is also present in Europe through western Turkey. Because of its clinical incidence and the restrictions on animal movements, PPR is a disease of major economic importance. A live attenuated vaccine was developed in the 1980s, and has been widely used in sheep and goats. Current researches aim (i) to make it more thermotolerant for use in countries with limited cold chain, and (ii) to add a DIVA mark to shorten and reduce the cost of final eradication. Rinderpest virus-another Morbillivirus-was the first animal virus to be eradicated from Earth. PPRV has been proposed as the next candidate. Considering its wide distribution and its multiple target host species which have an intense mobility, it will be a long process that cannot exclusively rely on mass vaccination. PPR specific epidemiological features and socio-economic considerations will also have to be taken into account, and sustained international, coordinated, and funded strategy based on a regional approach of PPR control will be the guarantee toward success.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0378-1135(12)00691-8"

In Kenya, their national coverage gaps are substantial but could be largely improved if the total population had the same coverage as the wealthiest quintile. A decomposition analysis allows identifying the factors that influence these wealth-related inequalities in order to develop appropriate policy responses. The main objective of the study was to decompose wealth-related inequalities in SBA and measles immunization into their contributing factors.METHODS: Data from the Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey 2008/09 were used. The study investigated the effects of socio-economic determinants on [1] coverage and [2] wealth-related inequalities of SBA utilization and measles immunization. Techniques used were multivariate logistic regression and decomposition of the concentration index (C).RESULTS: SBA utilization and measles immunization coverage differed according to household wealth, parent's education, skilled antenatal care visits, birth order and father's occupation. SBA utilization further differed across provinces and ethnic groups. The overall C for SBA was 0.14 and was mostly explained by wealth (40%), parent's education (28%), antenatal care (9%), and province (6%). The overall C for measles immunization was 0.08 and was mostly explained by wealth (60%), birth order (33%), and parent's education (28%). Rural residence (-19%) reduced this inequality.CONCLUSION: Both health care indicators require a broad strengthening of health systems with a special focus on disadvantaged sub-groups.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-9276-12-3"

The current picture is troubling, but not altogether unexpected. Ebola was initially identified in 1976, and since that time, few drugs have been developed to combat it. The same is true for myriad other dangerous infectious diseases to which the world is currently susceptible. One proposal that might prevent outbreaks of this scale and magnitude from recurring would be to have the World Health Organization (WHO) and its technical partners assess which of its member states are at high risk for a disease, either directly or indirectly, and facilitate the creation of international governmental risk pools of those member states. Risk pools would offer open-indexed grant contracts to fund vaccine and drug development for a particular disease, and pharmaceutical companies could browse the index to apply for these grants. If the risk-pool states and a particular company sign a contract, a mutually agreed upon amount of the vaccine or drug would be produced at a below-market purchase price for those states. In return, the company would keep any patents or intellectual property rights for the developed vaccines or drugs. Risk-pool countries that did not use their vaccine or drug could resell that supply on secondary markets to other countries outside of the risk pool. This arrangement will increase the supply of tested drug and vaccine candidates available for combatting unexpected outbreaks of any previously discovered major infectious disease in the future.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25506281"

The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in that country.METHODS: We used a published decision tree model that has been adapted to the Libyan situation to analyze a birth cohort of 160,000 children. The evaluation of diarrhea events in three public hospitals helped to estimate the rotavirus burden. The economic analysis was done from two perspectives: health care provider and societal. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty in some values of the variables selected.RESULTS: The three hospitals received 545 diarrhea patients aged≤5 with 311 (57%) rotavirus positive test results during a 9-month period. The societal cost for treatment of a case of rotavirus diarrhea was estimated at US$ 661/event. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with a vaccine price of US$ 27 per course was US$ 8,972 per quality-adjusted life year gained from the health care perspective. From a societal perspective, the analysis shows cost savings of around US$ 16 per child.CONCLUSION: The model shows that rotavirus vaccination could be economically a very attractive intervention in Libya.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26236"

This study uses tobacco plants to express pentameric capsomeres of HPV that have been reported to generate elevated immune responses against HPV. A modified HPV-16 L1 (L1_2xCysM) protein has been expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in tobacco chloroplasts following biolistic transformation. In total 7 transplastomic lines with healthy phenotypes were generated. Site specific integration of the GST-L1_2xCysM and aadA genes was confirmed by PCR. Southern blot analysis verified homogenous transformation of all transplastomic lines. Antigen capture ELISA with the conformation-specific antibody Ritti01, showed protein expression as well as the retention of immunogenic epitopes of L1 protein. In their morphology, GST-L1 expressing tobacco plants were identical to wild type plants and yielded fertile flowers.

The Health Belief Model was used to guide data abstraction and synthesis.RESULTS: Fourteen unique studies representing ten sub-Saharan African countries were identified, with more than half published within the last two years. Acceptability of the HPV vaccine for daughters was high (range 59-100%); however, vaccine-related awareness and knowledge were low. Perceived barriers including accessibility and cost concerns were important for acceptance, as were cues to action from healthcare providers and governments.CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that acceptability of the HPV vaccine in countries in this region will be high. Broad knowledge gaps were highlighted regarding HPV and cervical cancer and these should be addressed.

Over 29 days, 400/644 (62.1%) cattle were recorded as displaying clinical signs consistent with FMD. Out of the 18 management groups present, 17 had clinical cases (weighted mean incidence rate 3.5 per 100 cattle-days, 95% CI 2.4, 5.1; range 0.064-10.9). Transmission may have been encouraged when an infected group was moved to a designated isolation paddock. A four to five day minimum incubation period was apparent in five groups for which a point source exposure was evident. Further transmission was associated with the movement of individual animals incubating infection, use of a common dip and milking parlour, and grazing of susceptible groups in paddocks neighbouring to infectious cases. Animals over 18 months old appeared to be at highest risk of disease possibly due to milder clinical signs seen among younger animals resulting in reduced transmission or cases not being recorded. Cows with a breeding pedigree containing a greater proportion of zebu appeared to be at lower risk of disease. The outbreak occurred despite regular vaccination (three times per year) last performed approximately three months before the index case. Incidence risk by the lifetime number of doses received indicated limited or no vaccine effectiveness against clinical disease. Reasons for poor vaccine effectiveness are discussed with antigenic diversity of the SAT2 serotype and poor match between the field and vaccine strain as a likely explanation. Detailed field-derived epidemiological data based on individual animals are rarely presented in the literature for FMD, particularly in East-Africa and with the SAT2 serotype. This study provides a detailed account and therefore provides a greater understanding of FMD outbreaks in this setting. Additionally, this is the first study to provide field-derived evidence of poor vaccine effectiveness using a SAT2 vaccine. Further field-based measures of vaccine effectiveness in line with evaluation of human vaccines are needed to inform FMD control policy which has previously relied heavily upon experimental data and anecdotal experience.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25447264"

Previously, we reported on the expression and purification of a highly promising hookworm vaccine candidate, Na-GST-1, an N. americanus glutathione s-transferase expressed in Pichia pastoris (yeast), which led to production of 1.5 g of 95% pure recombinant protein at a 20L scale.

However, based on the number of doses which would be required to allow mass vaccination and a potential goal to deliver a vaccine as inexpensively as possible, a higher yield of expression of the recombinant antigen at the lowest possible cost is highly desirable. Here we report on modifications to the fermentation (upstream process) of the antigen expressed in P. pastoris, and to the purification (downstream process) of the recombinant protein that allowed for a 2-3-fold improvement in the final yield of Na-GST-1 purified protein. The major improvements included upstream process changes such as the addition of a sorbitol pulse and co-feed during methanol induction as well as an extension of the induction stage to approximately 96 hours; downstream process changes included modifying the UFDF to flat sheet with a 10 kDa Molecular Weight cut-off (MWCO), adjusting the capacity of an ion-exchange chromatography step utilizing a gradient elution as opposed to the original step elution, and altering the hydrophobic interaction chromatography conditions.

Fifteen years later, this argument can be rethought at the light of the current context of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Ivory Coast. In fact, in this country, the challenges caused by HBVecho those of HIV/AIDS fifteen years ago: high prevalence (8-10%), ignorance of the disease, and high cost of care. To this end, this article compares the role of private companies in the fights against HIV/AIDS in the 2000s and its role in the fight against HBV today. Although some private firms played a critical role in the promotion of universal access to ART, today, they are one of the few places where HBV screening, vaccination and treatment are offered in the country. HIV/AIDS opened the door for private companies to address other diseases through their health care systems. However, many challenges still need to be met: the absence of qualitative ongoing training for health professionals, illness representations and the costs of treatments, which are all related to the lack of international and national collective action. In Ivory Coast, at the early stage of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, national authorities took up the leadership in the fight against AIDS in West Africa, by developing extraverted strategies (Xth ICASA's organization, Unaids initiative hosting). The exceptional international mobilization and the creation of innovative funding mechanisms [International Therapeutic Solidarity Fund (ITSF), Global Fund (GM), and President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)] have facilitated easy access to ARV. Although 380 million people are infected by chronic HBV in the world, even so, international and national collective actions are fledgling and remained weak. Moreover, private firms have represented leverage for testing, treatment, and the provision of universal access to medication in the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ivory Coast, as relayed by other public and private actors. In the HBV context, private companies can only be a vector for the development of a two tier healthcare system. Therefore, the lack of a strong international commitment prevents public and private local initiatives to generalize HBV prevention and treatment.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25407333"

The objective of this study is to examine the extent to which maternal health services are utilised in Ghana, and whether inequities in accessibility to and utilization of services have been eliminated following the implementation of a user-fee exemption policy, that aims to reduce financial barriers to access, reduce inequities in access, and improve access to and use of birthing services.METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2007 Ghana Maternal Health Survey for inequities in access to and utilization of maternal health services. In measuring the inequities, frequency tables and cross-tabulations were used to compare rates of service utilization by region, residence and selected socio-demographic variables.RESULTS: Findings show marginal increases in accessibility to and utilisation of skilled antenatal, delivery and postnatal care services following the policy implementation (2003-2007). However, large gradients of inequities exist between geographic regions, urban and rural areas, and different socio-demographic, religious and ethnic groupings. More urban women (40%) than rural, 53% more women in the highest wealth quintile than women in the lowest, 38% more women in the best performing region (Central Region) than the worst (Upper East Region), and 48% more women with at least secondary education than those with no formal education, accessed and used all components of skilled maternal health services in the five years preceding the survey. Our findings raise questions about the potential equity and distributional benefits of Ghana's user-fee exemption policy, and the role of non-financial barriers or considerations.CONCLUSION: Exempting user-fees for maternal health services is a promising policy option for improving access to maternal health care, but might be insufficient on its own to secure equitable access to maternal health services in Ghana. Ensuring equity in access will require moving beyond user-fee exemption to addressing wider issues of supply and demand factors and the social determinants of health, including redistributing healthcare resources and services, and redressing the positional vulnerability of women in their communities.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12939-014-0089-z"

However, household also use other methods of prevention. Thus far, there is little knowledge about the expenditures of these malaria prevention methods, particularly in combination with the national interventions. This paper presents the utilization levels and expenditures of malaria prevention tools in Burkina Faso and explores the potential inequality in ownership.METHODS: The analysis is based on a cross-sectional survey, conducted during the 2010 high transmission season from July to September in the Nanoro Health and Demographic Surveillance Site. Following a systematic sampling technique, the survey covers 500 households with children under 5 years of age from 24 villages. In the survey, households were asked about expenditures on malaria prevention methods in the month preceding the survey. This includes expenditure on coils, indoor spraying, aerosols, repellents, herbs, cleaning of the environment and clearing of the vegetation. The data analysis was conducted with SPSS taking into account the socio-economic status (SES) of the household to examine any differences in the utilization of the prevention method and expenditure quintiles. An asset-based index, created through principal components analysis (PCA), was used to categorize the households into quintiles.FINDINGS: Of the households surveyed, 45% used one preventive measure in the past month; 29% used two measures; and 25% used three or more measures. A significant association was found between the number of prevention measures and the SES of the household (p &lt; 0.05). The majority of households owned at least one insecticide treated net (ITN) (98%). Among households that used ITN, 53.8% used methods other than bed nets. The majority of households paid nothing for malaria prevention.CONCLUSION: Most of the households received bed nets and other preventive method for free. There is equity in expenditures across SES groups. Free distribution of ITNs ensured that there was equity in ITN ownership among households. More research on the possibility of increasing access to other locally relevant methods of malaria control that proved to be effective is need.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12939-014-0108-0"

We draw upon service marketing theory, organisational sociology, development anthropology and cultural consumer research to conduct an ethnographic study of vaccination delivery in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia - one such region. We find that Western public health sector policies are dominated by an administrative logic. Critical failures in delivery are produced by a system that obfuscates the on-the-ground problems that mothers face in trying to vaccinate their children, while instead prioritising administrative processes. Our ethnographic analysis of 83 mothers who had not vaccinated their children reveals key barriers to vaccination from a 'customer' perspective. While mothers value vaccination, it is a 'low involvement' good compared to the acute daily needs of a subsistence life. The costs imposed by poor service - such as uncaring staff with class hostilities, unpredictable and missed schedules and long waits - are too much and so they forego the service. Our service design framework illuminates specific service problems from the mother's perspective and points towards simple service innovations that could improve vaccination rates in regions that have poor uptake.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25363481"

The Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey of 2008 indicated that only 5.4% of children aged 12-23 months in Bungudu, Zamfara State were fully immunized. We conducted this study to identify the determinants of routine immunization coverage in this community.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study. We sampled 450 children aged 12-23 months. We interviewed mothers of these children using structured questionnaire to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge on immunization, vaccination status of children and reasons for non-vaccination. We defined a fully immunized child as a child who had received one dose of BCG, three doses of oral polio vaccine, three doses of Diptheria-Pertusis-Tetanus vaccine and one dose of measles vaccine by 12 months of age. We performed bivariate analysis and logistic regression using Epi-info software.RESULTS: The mean age of mothers and children were 27 years (standard error (SE): 0.27 year) and 17 months (SE: 0.8 month) respectively. Seventy nine percent of mothers had no formal education while 84% did not possess satisfactory knowledge on immunization. Only 7.6% of children were fully immunized. Logistic regression showed that possessing satisfactory knowledge (Adjusted OR=18.4, 95% CI=3.6-94.7) and at least secondary education (Adjusted OR=3.6, 95% CI=1.2-10.6) were significantly correlated with full immunization.CONCLUSION: The major determinants of immunization coverage were maternal knowledge and educational status. Raising the level of maternal knowledge and increasing maternal literacy level are essential to improve immunization coverage in this community.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.11694/pamj.supp.2014.18.1.4149"

Although switching from 10-dose vials to 5-dose vials could reduce wastage, a higher total cost could be triggered because smaller vials cost more to purchase and store.METHODS: This study drew field data of daily session sizes in local vaccination facilities from Bangladesh, India (Uttar Pradesh), Mozambique, and Uganda, and used Akaike Information Criteria to determine the best fit statistical distribution across various clinic types. These distributions were input to estimate the vaccine wastage using Lee's (2010) model. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) immunization was simulated to compare the costs over ten years with 10-dose vials versus 5-dose vials.RESULTS: By switching from 10- to 5-dose vials, the observed open vial wastage rate due to vial size preference and session size for IPV was reduced from 0.25 to 0.11 in Bangladesh, 0.17 to 0.08 in India (Uttar Pradesh), 0.13 to 0.06 in Mozambique, and 0.09 to 0.04 in Uganda, respectively. The cost savings realized from lower IPV wastage did not offset the higher costs of procurement and storage costs associated with smaller dose presentation.CONCLUSION: While our model showed that switching from 10-dose vials to 5-dose vials of IPV reduced open vial wastage, it was not cost-saving.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25306911"

Liver disease involves infectious, malignant and chronic aetiologies with overlapping symptoms. Where available mortality data come from verbal autopsies, separating different types of liver disease is challenging. Cirrhosis is a disease of rich and poor alike; key public health risk factors such as alcohol consumption play an important role. Risk-reduction strategies such as controlling the price of alcohol are being widely discussed. Since these estimates used alcohol consumption as a covariate, they cannot be used to explore relationships between alcohol consumption and cirrhosis mortality.

Survey and interview data were collected at the national level and in 2 regions in July and August 2011, with additional interviews in January 2012.FINDINGS: Many health system functions were not affected-either positively or negatively-by the MenA vaccine introduction. The majority of effects were felt on the immunization program. Benefits included strengthened communication and social mobilization, surveillance, and provider skills. Drawbacks included the interruption of routine vaccination services in the majority of health facilities surveyed (67%). The average daily number of children receiving routine vaccinations was 79% to 87% lower during the 10-day campaign period than during other periods of the month. Antenatal care consultations were also reduced during the campaign period by 10% to 15%. Key informants argued that, with an average of 14 campaigns per year, mass campaigns would have a substantial cumulative negative effect on routine health services. Many also argued that the MenA campaign missed potential opportunities for health systems strengthening because integration with other health services was lacking.CONCLUSION: The MenA vaccine introduction interrupted routine vaccination and other health services. When introducing a new vaccine through a campaign, coverage of routine health services should be monitored alongside campaign vaccine coverage to highlight where and how long services are disrupted and to mitigate risks to routine services.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.9745/GHSP-D-13-00130"

Key questions relate to the control challenges and economic impact of the disease for resource-poor FMD endemic countries like Zambia. A review of the control challenges and economic impact of FMD outbreaks in Zambia was made. Information was collected from peer-reviewed journals articles, conference proceedings, unpublished scientific reports, and personal communication with scientists and personal field experiences. The challenges of controlling FMD using mainly vaccination and movement control are discussed. Impacts include losses in income of over US$ 1.6 billion from exports of beef and sable antelopes and an annual cost of over US$ 2.7 million on preventive measures. Further impacts included unquantified losses in production and low investment in agriculture resulting in slow economic growth. FMD persistence may be a result of inadequate epidemiological understanding of the disease and ineffectiveness of the control measures that are being applied.

Inter-views were conducted with 261 national, regional and district key informants and questionnaires were completed with staff from 196 health facilities. Routine data from districts and health facilities were gathered on vaccination and antenatal service use. Data collection and analysis were structured around the World Health Organisation health system building blocks.FINDINGS: The new vaccines were viewed positively and seemed to integrate well into existing health systems. The introductions were found to have had no impact on many elements within the building blocks framework. Despite many key informants and facility respondents perceiving that the new vaccine introductions had increased coverage of other vaccines, the routine data showed no change. Positive effects perceived included enhanced credibility of the immunisation programme and strengthened health workers' skills through training. Negative effects reported included an increase in workload and stock outs of the new vaccine, which created a perception in the community that all vaccines were out of stock in a facility. Most effects were found within the vaccination programmes; very few were reported on the broader health systems. Effects were primarily reported to be temporary, around the time of introduction only.CONCLUSION: Although the new vaccine introductions were viewed as intrinsically positive, on the whole there was no evidence that they had any major impact, positive or negative, on the broader health systems.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25261379"

This is attributed to the unavailability of proper water treatment, sanitary infrastructure and poor hygiene. As a consequence, countries facing cholera outbreaks rely on interventions such as the use of oral rehydration therapy and antibiotics to save lives. In addition to vaccination, the provision of chlorine tablets and hygiene sensitization drives have been used to prevent new cholera infections. The implementation of these interventions remains a challenge due to constraints associated with the cost, ease of use and technical knowhow. These challenges have been reduced through the use of solar water disinfection (SODIS). The success of SODIS in mitigating the risk associated with the consumption of waterborne pathogens has been associated with solar irradiation. This has prompted a lot of focus on the solar component for enhanced disinfection. However, the role played by the host immune system following the consumption of solar-irradiated water pathogens has not received any significant attention. The mode of inactivation resulting from the exposure of microbiologically contaminated water results in immunologically important microbial states as well as components. In this review, the possible influence that solar water disinfection may have on the immunity against cholera is discussed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.2166/wh.2014.158"

A number of potential new TB vaccine candidates have been identified and are currently in clinical trials. One such candidate is MVA85A. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding the MVA85A vaccine as a booster to the BCG vaccine in children from the perspective of the South African government.METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was assessed by employing Decision Analytic Modelling, through the use of a Markov model. The model compared the existing strategy of BCG vaccination to a new strategy in which infants receive BCG and a booster vaccine, MVA85A, at 4 months of age. The costs and outcomes of the two strategies are estimated through modelling the vaccination of a hypothetical cohort of newborns and following them from birth through to 10 years of age, employing 6-monthly cycles.RESULTS: The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis indicate that the MVA85A strategy is both more costly and more effective - there are fewer TB cases and deaths from TB than BCG alone. The South African government would need to spend an additional USD 1,105 for every additional TB case averted and USD 284,017 for every additional TB death averted. The threshold analysis shows that, if the efficacy of the MVA85A vaccine was 41.3% (instead of the current efficacy of 17.3%), the two strategies would have the same cost but more cases of TB and more deaths from TB would be prevented by adding the MVA85A vaccine to the BCG vaccine. In this case, the government chould consider the MVA85A strategy.CONCLUSIONS: At the current level of efficacy, the MVA85A vaccine is neither effective nor cost-effective and, therefore, not a good use of limited resources. Nevertheless, this study contributes to developing a standardized Markov model, which could be used, in the future, to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of new TB vaccines compared to the BCG vaccine, in children between the ages of 0-10 years.

In some settings, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a high prevalence of HIV infection and a high burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. There is evidence suggesting that the immunity induced by some commonly used vaccines is not durable in HIV-infected persons, and therefore, repeated vaccination may be considered to ensure optimal vaccine-induced immunity in this population. However, some vaccines, particularly the live vaccines, may be unsafe in HIV-infected persons. There is lack of evidence on the safety profile of commonly used vaccines among HIV-infected persons. We are therefore conducting a systematic review to assess the safety profile of routine vaccines administered to HIV-infected persons.DESIGN: We will select studies conducted in any setting where licensed and effective vaccines were administered to HIV-infected persons. We will search for eligible studies in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, Africa-Wide, PDQ-Evidence and CINAHL as well as reference lists of relevant publications. We will screen search outputs, select studies and extract data in duplicate, resolving discrepancies by discussion and consensus.DISCUSSION: Globally, immunisation is a major public health strategy to mitigate morbidity and mortality caused by various infectious disease-causing agents. In general, there are efforts to increase vaccination coverage worldwide, and for these efforts to be successful, safety of the vaccines is paramount, even among people living with HIV, who in some situations may require repeated vaccination. Results from this systematic review will be discussed in the context of the safety of routine vaccines among HIV-infected persons. From the safety perspective, we will also discuss whether repeat vaccination strategies may be feasible among HIV-infected persons.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42014009794.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=2046-4053-3-101"

Despite progress in the field of adolescent health, many young people in Africa still get sick and die from vaccine-preventable diseases due to lack of vaccination. Parents, adolescents and teachers are key players with regard to implementation of adolescent vaccination policies. Therefore, understanding their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards adolescent vaccination may provide clues on what can be done to improve vaccine uptake among adolescents. The aim of this study is to conduct a qualitative and quantitative systematic review on knowledge, attitudes and practices on adolescent vaccination among parents, teachers and adolescents in Africa.METHODS: We will include both quantitative and qualitative primary studies. Eligible quantitative studies include both intervention and observational studies. Qualitative studies to be included are focus group discussions, direct observations, in-depth interviews and case ethnographic studies. We will search PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, WHOLIS, Africa Wide and CINAHL for eligible studies with no time and language limits.

Second-generation HPV vaccines include a 9-valent vaccine, which targets five additional oncogenic HPV types (i.e., 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) that contribute to another 15-30% of cervical cancer cases. The objective of this study was to determine a range of vaccine costs for which the 9-valent vaccine would be cost-effective in comparison to the current vaccines in two less developed countries (i.e., Kenya and Uganda).METHODS AND FINDINGS: The analysis was performed using a natural history disease simulation model of HPV and cervical cancer. The mathematical model simulates individual women from an early age and tracks health events and resource use as they transition through clinically-relevant health states over their lifetime. Epidemiological data on HPV prevalence and cancer incidence were used to adapt the model to Kenya and Uganda. Health benefit, or effectiveness, from HPV vaccination was measured in terms of life expectancy, and costs were measured in international dollars (I$). The incremental cost of the 9-valent vaccine included the added cost of the vaccine counterbalanced by costs averted from additional cancer cases prevented. All future costs and health benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3% in the base case analysis. We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate how infection with multiple HPV types, unidentifiable HPV types in cancer cases, and cross-protection against non-vaccine types could affect the potential cost range of the 9-valent vaccine. In the base case analysis in Kenya, we found that vaccination with the 9-valent vaccine was very cost-effective (i.e., had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below per-capita GDP), compared to the current vaccines provided the added cost of the 9-valent vaccine did not exceed I$9.7 per vaccinated girl. To be considered very cost-effective, the added cost per vaccinated girl could go up to I$5.2 and I$16.2 in the worst-case and best-case scenarios, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times per-capita GDP where the 9-valent vaccine would be considered cost-effective, the thresholds of added costs associated with the 9-valent vaccine were I$27.3, I$14.5 and I$45.3 per vaccinated girl for the base case, worst-case and best-case scenarios, respectively. In Uganda, vaccination with the 9-valent vaccine was very cost-effective when the added cost of the 9-valent vaccine did not exceed I$8.3 per vaccinated girl. To be considered very cost-effective, the added cost per vaccinated girl could go up to I$4.5 and I$13.7 in the worst-case and best-case scenarios, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times per-capita GDP, the thresholds of added costs associated with the 9-valent vaccine were I$23.4, I$12.6 and I$38.4 per vaccinated girl for the base case, worst-case and best-case scenarios, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a threshold range of incremental costs associated with the 9-valent HPV vaccine that would make it a cost-effective intervention in comparison to currently available HPV vaccines in Kenya and Uganda. These prices represent a 71% and 61% increase over the price offered to the GAVI Alliance ($5 per dose) for the currently available 2- and 4-valent vaccines in Kenya and Uganda, respectively. Despite evidence of cost-effectiveness, critical challenges around affordability and feasibility of HPV vaccination and other competing needs in low-resource settings such as Kenya and Uganda remain.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0106836"

Following that, large outbreaks appeared in 1995 in Zaire with 250 deaths of people, 2001-2002 in Uganda with 224 deaths, 2002-2003 in Congo with 128 deaths, and 2007 in Congo with 187 deaths. In 2014, the most severe and complicated outbreak swept through the West African countries having already taken 1069 lives, with the situation seeming to be out of control. To date, there have been 15 outbreaks in Africa, which have caused 4362 infected cases and claimed 2659 lives. The pandemics of Ebola show obvious independence from any season. Humans are generally susceptible to the Ebola virus without gender or age variation. The natural reservoir of the Ebola virus still remains unclear. During the past 40 years or so, the EVD disappeared after an outbreak in one region and erupted in another region without any warning. The difficulty in understanding the spreading pattern of Ebola was compared to that of the wave-particle duality of light.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1631/jzus.B1400222"

The mortality of women and children is significantly higher compared with other developing countries. The death of women and children can be prevented by simple cost-effective community-based interventions. The aim of this present study was to learn the knowledge levels of women on maternal and child health, and treatment-seeking and preventive behaviours in rural Sierra Leone and provide appropriate suggestions for policy makers. Moreover, the study also aimed to evaluate the effect of a husband's involvement on health knowledge and practices of women in rural Sierra Leone.METHODS: Women with at least a child of five years or below were interviewed in their households through a structured questionnaire. Characteristics of the households and of the respondents were collected and the number of correct answers given to the health knowledge and practice questions and their percentage distributions were tabulated and an overall health knowledge score was calculated.RESULTS: The mean score of the derived overall health-related knowledge was 61.6% (maximum of 91% and a minimum of 18%) with a standard deviation of 14.7% and a median of 63.3%. Multivariable regression analyses showed education and number of pregnancies are associated with knowledge score, with significantly improved health knowledge scores amongst those who accessed higher education. There were some inappropriate practices in hygiene and sanitation. However, vaccination coverage was high with almost 100% coverage for BCG.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings of this study, women's knowledge on maternal and child health care are inadequate in rural Sierra Leone. Health promotion activities focusing on prevention of diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia, improvement in health-related knowledge on pregnancy, delivery, neonatal care and environmental sanitation would be invaluable.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0105936"

In line with this new research, we set forth a framework for conceptualizing the full benefits of vaccination, including avoided medical care costs, outcome-related productivity gains, behavior-related productivity gains, community health externalities, community economic externalities, and the value of risk reduction and pure health gains. We also review literature highlighting the magnitude of these sources of benefit for different vaccinations.

Existing literature, however, has only examined small cross-section samples from a few confined survey sites or has failed to adequately control for the many factors that may mediate the effects of religion. This paper examines the effects of the Apostolic faith on the usage of maternal health and child immunization services in Zimbabwe. It is based on a nationally representative sample from the 2009 Multi-Indicator Monitoring Survey and employs the established Andersen model on access to health services. Well controlled multivariate logit regression models derived from these data show that an affiliation with the Apostolic faith is a substantial and significant risk factor in reducing the utilization of both maternal and child health services. Moreover, even when the services were least costly and readily available and when gaps along other social and economic factors were limited, as in the case of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination and one visit to antenatal care, women and children from Apostolic faith families still fared significantly worse than others in accessing them.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25108694"

Valid, reliable and comparable measures of health status of individuals are critical components of the evidence base for health policy. The need for sound information is especially urgent in the case of emerging diseases and other acute health threats, where rapid awareness, investigation and response can save lives and prevent broader national outbreaks and even global pandemics.METHODS: Ten percent of all households visited by CHWs for data collection in different sites (rural and peri-urban) were systematically selected and visited a second time by technically trained research team members. The test-retest method was applied to establish reliability. The Kappa score was used to measure reliability, while sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were used to measure validity.RESULTS: Inter-observer agreement between the two sets of data in both sites was good; most indicators measured slight agreement. However, some indicators demonstrated greater discrepancies between the two data sets (e.g. measles immunization). Specificity measures were more stable in Butere (rural), which had more than 90% in all the indicators tested, compared to Nyalenda (peri-urban), which fluctuated between 50% and 90%. There were variable reliability results in the peri-urban site for the indicators measured, while the rural site presented more stable results. This is also depicted in the validity measures in both sites.CONCLUSIONS: The paper concludes that there are convincing results that CHWs can accurately and reliably collect certain types of community data which has cost-saving implications, especially for resource poor settings.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1472-6963-14-S1-S5"

However, resource implications of expanding socioeconomic support are large, and cost-effectiveness analysis can inform budget priorities. We compared the incremental benefits and costs of providing education, food, or both forms of support (dual support) with existing ART services from a health care provider's perspective.METHODS: Costs and outcome data were collected from a cohort of 2371 adult patients with HIV receiving education, food, or dual support from Reach Out Mbuya between 2004 and 2010. The primary outcome was averted loss to follow-up. The number of follow-up days was calculated for each patient along with accrued service and fixed program costs for the alternative forms of socioeconomic support in USD by standard costing methods. The socioeconomic support types were compared incrementally over the study period.RESULTS: After 7 years, 762 (33%) of the patients were loss to follow-up with 42% of them receiving food. In the presence of providing ART, education support was less costly and more effective than the alternatives. The average unit cost for education, food, and dual support were $237, $538, and $776, respectively. The average total annual costs were $88,643 for education, $538,005 for food, and $103,045 for dual support.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with food or dual support, investing in education of the children of ART patients is less costly and more effective in improving patient retention. Reach Out Mbuya should embrace this paradigm shift and channel its resources more efficiently and effectively by focusing on education support.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/QAI.0000000000000280"

Mass vaccination, along with the effective control of dog populations, has been used successfully in industrialised countries to control this disease. A lower success rate in developing countries is due to a number of factors, including vaccination campaigns that do not cover a sufficient number of animals or reach all communities, and a wide biodiversity that increases the number of reservoirs of the rabies virus. Educational programmes are needed, which focus on the commitment involved when acquiring a domestic animal, stating clearly what is required to provide it with a good quality of life. New technologies developed in the industrialised world will not always be successful in less developed countries. Approaches must be adapted to the particular conditions in each country, taking cultural and socio-economic issues into account. Authorities must promote research on dog population dynamics, the development of non-invasive methods to control dog populations and the most efficient, stable and low-cost options for vaccination. Under the One Health model, it is hoped that dog-transmitted human rabies will be accorded high priority as a zoonosis by human health authorities, international authorities and donor agencies to support ambitious eradication goals, particularly those being set in South-East Asia. Well-designed and adequately resourced vaccination programmes, based on the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines, will have significant animal welfare benefits, due to the availability of improved vaccines (in terms of efficacy, duration of immunity, ease of administration and lower cost), advances in dog population management and the more widespread implementation of the OIE Guidelines on Stray Dog Control. Animal welfare benefits include not only the elimination of pain and suffering caused by the clinical disease itself, but also the avoidance of the indirect impact of inhumane culling when methods are used that have not been approved by the OIE.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25000804"

However, there is limited evidence on how private providers compare to public providers, particularly for preventive services such as immunizations. We used data from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to assess public-private differences in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine delivery.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used demographic and health surveys from 102,629 children aged 0-59 months from 29 countries across SSA to measure differences in BCG status for children born at private versus public health facilities (BCG is recommended at birth). We used a probit model to estimate public-private differences in BCG delivery, while controlling for key confounders. Next, we estimated how differences in BCG status evolved over time for children born at private versus public facilities. Finally, we estimated heterogeneity in public-private differences based on wealth and rural-urban residency. We found that children born at a private facility were 7.1 percentage points less likely to receive BCG vaccine in the same month as birth than children born at a public facility (95% CI 6.3-8.0; p&lt;0.001). Most of this difference was driven by for-profit private providers (as opposed to NGOs) where the BCG provision rate was 10.0 percentage points less than public providers (95% CI 9.0-11.2; p&lt;0.001) compared to only 2.4 percentage points for NGOs (95% CI 1.0-3. 8; p&lt;0.01). Moreover, children born at private for-profit facilities remained less likely to be vaccinated up to 59 months after birth. Finally, public-private differences were more pronounced for poorer children and children in rural areas.CONCLUSIONS: The for-profit private sector performed substantially worse than the public sector in providing BCG vaccine to newborns, resulting in a longer duration of vulnerability to tuberculosis. This disparity was greater for poorer children and children in rural areas.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24951863"

In 1993, all five countries were producing vaccines but the processes used were outdated and non-standardized, there was little relevant research and there was negligible international recognition of the products. By 2014, all five countries had strong initiatives for the development of vaccine technology and had greatly improved their national regulatory capacity. South Africa was then the only BRICS country that was not completely producing vaccines. South Africa is now in the process of re-establishing its own vaccine production and passing beyond the stage of simply importing, formulating and filling vaccine bulks. Changes in the public sector's price per dose of selected vaccines, the global market share represented by products from specific manufacturers, and the attractiveness, for multinational companies, of partnership and investment opportunities in BRICS companies have all been analysed. The results indicate that the BRICS countries have had a major impact on vaccine price and availability, with much of that impact attributable to the output of Indian vaccine manufacturers. China is expected to have a greater impact soon, given the anticipated development of Chinese vaccine manufacturers in the near future. BRICS' accomplishments in the field of vaccine development are expected to reshape the global vaccine market and accelerate access to vaccines in the developing world.

Identifying and addressing such challenges, beyond cost and cold-chain space, including safety considerations and health worker behavior, regulatory alliances and harmonization to foster access to vaccines, will help countries to ensure sustainable immunization. There needs to be continuous and close management of the global vaccine supply both at national and international levels, requiring careful risk management, coordination and cooperation with manufacturers. Successful partnership models based on sharing a common goal, mutual respect and good communication were discussed among stakeholders.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24923638"

The included studies comprised of randomised controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies evaluating the impact of CCTs on child health. Due to the substantial heterogeneity of the studies, a narrative synthesis was conducted on the extracted data.RESULTS: Sixteen studies predominantly from Latin American countries met the inclusion criteria. The outcomes reported by the studies in relation to CCTs' effectiveness in improving child health were reduction in morbidity risk, improvement in nutritional outcomes, health services utilisation, and immunisation coverage.CONCLUSIONS: The review suggests that to a large extent, CCTs are effective in improving child health by addressing child health determinants such as access to health care, child and maternal nutrition, morbidity risk, immunisation coverage, and household poverty in developing countries particularly middle-income countries. Of importance to both policy and practice, it appears that CCTs require effective functioning of health care systems to effectively promote child health.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007/s00038-014-0570-x"

Presently there are two prophylactic vaccines on the market, protecting against the two most common high-risk HPV types 16 and 18. These vaccines remain very expensive and are not generally affordable in developing countries where they are needed most. Additionally, there remains a need to treat women that are already infected with HPV, and who have high-grade lesions or cervical cancer.METHODS: In this paper, we characterize the immunogenicity of a therapeutic vaccine that targets the E7 protein of the most prevalent high-risk HPV - type 16 - the gene which has previously been shown to be effective in DNA vaccine trials in mice. The synthetic shuffled HPV-16 E7 (16E7SH) has lost its transforming properties but retains all naturally-occurring CTL epitopes. This was genetically fused to Zera®, a self-assembly domain of the maize γ-zein able to induce the accumulation of recombinant proteins into protein bodies (PBs), within the endoplasmic reticulum in a number of expression systems.RESULTS: High-level expression of the HPV 16E7SH protein fused to Zera® in plants was achieved, and the protein bodies could be easily and cost-effectively purified. Immune responses comparable to the 16E7SH DNA vaccine were demonstrated in the murine model, with the protein vaccine successfully inducing a specific humoral as well as cell mediated immune response, and mediating tumour regression.CONCLUSIONS: The fusion of 16E7SH to the Zera® peptide was found to enhance the immune responses, presumably by means of a more efficient antigen presentation via the protein bodies. Interestingly, simply mixing the free PBs and 16E7SH also enhanced immune responses, indicating an adjuvant activity for the Zera® PBs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2407-14-367"

The evaluation model, a Markov model, estimated the annual number of CC cases at steady state in a population of 100,000 women for four alternative strategies: screening only; vaccination only; screening and vaccination; and no prevention. The results of the Markov model for each scenario were used as inputs to the optimization model determining the optimal proportion of the population to receive screening and/or vaccination under different scenarios. The scenarios varied by available budget, maximum screening and vaccination coverage, and overall reachable population.RESULTS: In the base-case optimization model analyses, with a coverage constraint of 20% for one lifetime screening, 95% for vaccination and a budget constraint of $1 per woman per year to minimize CC incidence, the optimal mix of prevention strategies would result in a reduction of CC incidence of 31% (3-dose vaccination available) or 46% (2-dose vaccination available) compared with CC incidence pre-vaccination. With a 3-dose vaccination schedule, the optimal combination of the different strategies across the population would be 20% screening alone, 39% vaccination alone and 41% with no prevention, while with a 2-dose vaccination schedule the optimal combination would be 71% vaccination alone, and 29% with no prevention. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results are sensitive to the constraints included in the optimization model as well as the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and CC treatment cost.CONCLUSIONS: The results of the optimization model indicate that, in Nigeria, the most efficient allocation of a limited budget would be to invest in both vaccination and screening with a 3-dose vaccination schedule, and in vaccination alone before implementing a screening program with a 2-dose vaccination schedule.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2407-14-365"

Shanchol is one of the two oral cholera vaccines prequalified by the World Health Organization; however, its effectiveness under field conditions and the protection it confers in the first months after administration remain unknown. The main objective of this study was to estimate the short-term effectiveness of two doses of Shanchol used as a part of the integrated response to a cholera outbreak in Africa.METHODS: We conducted a matched case-control study in Guinea between May 20 and October 19, 2012. Suspected cholera cases were confirmed by means of a rapid test, and controls were selected among neighbors of the same age and sex as the case patients. The odds of vaccination were compared between case patients and controls in bivariate and adjusted conditional logistic-regression models. Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1-odds ratio)×100.RESULTS: Between June 8 and October 19, 2012, we enrolled 40 case patients and 160 controls in the study for the primary analysis. After adjustment for potentially confounding variables, vaccination with two complete doses was associated with significant protection against cholera (effectiveness, 86.6%; 95% confidence interval, 56.7 to 95.8; P=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: In this study, Shanchol was effective when used in response to a cholera outbreak in Guinea. This study provides evidence supporting the addition of vaccination as part of the response to an outbreak. It also supports the ongoing efforts to establish a cholera vaccine stockpile for emergency use, which would enhance outbreak prevention and control strategies.

However, the estimated annual figure of almost 60,000 human rabies fatalities is probably an underestimate. Almost all cases of human rabies result from bites from infected dogs. Therefore, the most cost-effective approach to elimination of the global burden of human rabies is to control canine rabies rather than expansion of the availability of human prophylaxis. Mass vaccination campaigns with parenteral vaccines, and advances in oral vaccines for wildlife, have allowed the elimination of rabies in terrestrial carnivores in several countries worldwide. The subsequent reduction in cases of human rabies in such regions advocates the multidisciplinary One Health approach to rabies control through the mass vaccination of dogs and control of canine populations.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0140-6736(13)62707-5"

While increasing storage and transportation may be the most straightforward options, it is also important to consider what financial and operational benefits can be incurred. In 2012, suboptimal vaccine coverage and impending vaccine introductions prompted the Republic of Benin's Ministry of Health (MOH) to explore ways to improve their vaccine supply chain.METHODS: Working alongside the Beninese MOH, we utilized our computational model, HERMES, to explore the impact on cost and vaccine availability of three possible options: (1) consolidating the Commune level to a Health Zone level, (2) removing the Commune level completely, and (3) removing the Commune level and expanding to 12 Department Stores. We also analyzed the impact of adding shipping loops during delivery.RESULTS: At baseline, new vaccine introductions without any changes to the current system increased the logistics cost per dose ($0.23 to $0.26) and dropped the vaccine availability to 71%. While implementing the Commune level removal scenario had the same capital costs as implementing the Health Zone scenario, the Health Zone scenario had lower operating costs. This increased to an overall cost savings of $504,255 when implementing shipping loops.DISCUSSION: The best redesign option proved to be the synergistic approach of converting to the Health Zone design and using shipping loops (serving ten Health Posts/loop). While a transition to either redesign or only adding shipping loops was beneficial, implementing a redesign option and shipping loops can yield both lower capital expenditures and operating costs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24814550"

While eradication is not feasible due to the wildlife reservoir, large scale vaccination activities in Africa during the 1940s to 1960s reduced yellow fever incidence for several decades. However, after a period of low vaccination coverage, yellow fever has resurged in the continent. Since 2006 there has been substantial funding for large preventive mass vaccination campaigns in the most affected countries in Africa to curb the rising burden of disease and control future outbreaks. Contemporary estimates of the yellow fever disease burden are lacking, and the present study aimed to update the previous estimates on the basis of more recent yellow fever occurrence data and improved estimation methods.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Generalised linear regression models were fitted to a dataset of the locations of yellow fever outbreaks within the last 25 years to estimate the probability of outbreak reports across the endemic zone. Environmental variables and indicators for the surveillance quality in the affected countries were used as covariates. By comparing probabilities of outbreak reports estimated in the regression with the force of infection estimated for a limited set of locations for which serological surveys were available, the detection probability per case and the force of infection were estimated across the endemic zone. The yellow fever burden in Africa was estimated for the year 2013 as 130,000 (95% CI 51,000-380,000) cases with fever and jaundice or haemorrhage including 78,000 (95% CI 19,000-180,000) deaths, taking into account the current level of vaccination coverage. The impact of the recent mass vaccination campaigns was assessed by evaluating the difference between the estimates obtained for the current vaccination coverage and for a hypothetical scenario excluding these vaccination campaigns. Vaccination campaigns were estimated to have reduced the number of cases and deaths by 27% (95% CI 22%-31%) across the region, achieving up to an 82% reduction in countries targeted by these campaigns. A limitation of our study is the high level of uncertainty in our estimates arising from the sparseness of data available from both surveillance and serological surveys.CONCLUSIONS: With the estimation method presented here, spatial estimates of transmission intensity can be combined with vaccination coverage levels to evaluate the impact of past or proposed vaccination campaigns, thereby helping to allocate resources efficiently for yellow fever control. This method has been used by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI Alliance) to estimate the potential impact of future vaccination campaigns.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001638"

A conjoint analysis-contingent valuation was carried out on 190 households in Narok South District of Kenya to measure willingness to pay (WTP) and demand for CBPP vaccine and vaccination as well as factors affecting WTP. The mean WTP was calculated at Kenya Shillings (KSh) 212.48 (USD 3.03) for vaccination using a vaccine with the characteristics that were preferred by the farmers (preferred vaccine and vaccination) and KSh -71.45 (USD -1.02) for the currently used vaccine and vaccination. The proportion of farmers willing to pay an amount greater than zero was 66.7% and 34.4% for the preferred and current vaccine and vaccination respectively. About one third (33.3%) of farmers would need to be compensated an average amount of KSh 1162.62 (USD 13.68) per animal to allow their cattle to be vaccinated against CBPP using the preferred vaccine and vaccination. About two-thirds (65.6%) of farmers would need to be compensated an average amount of KSh 853.72 (USD 12.20) per animal to allow their cattle to be vaccinated against CBPP using the current vaccine and vaccination. The total amount of compensation would be KSh 61.39 million (USD 0.88 million) for the preferred vaccine and vaccination and KSh 90.15 million (USD 1.29 million) for the current vaccine and vaccination. Demand curves drawn from individual WTP demonstrated that only 59% and 27% of cattle owners with a WTP greater than zero were willing to pay a benchmark cost of KSh 34.60 for the preferred and current vaccine respectively. WTP was negatively influenced by the attitude about household economic situation (p=0.0078), presence of cross breeds in the herd (p&lt;0.0001) and years since CBPP had been experienced in the herd (p=0.0375). It was positively influenced by education (p=0.0251) and the practice of treating against CBPP (p=0.0432). The benefit cost ratio (BCR) for CBPP vaccination was 2.9-6.1 depending on the vaccination programme. In conclusion, although a proportion of farmers was willing to pay, participation levels may be lower than those required to interrupt transmission of CBPP. Households with characteristics that influence WTP negatively need persuasion to participate in CBPP vaccination. It is economically worthwhile to vaccinate against CBPP. A benefit cost analysis (BCA) using aggregated WTP as benefits can be used as an alternative method to the traditional BCA which uses avoided production losses (new revenue) and costs saved as benefits.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24774477"

This paper specifies four situations in which placebo use may be acceptable, provided that the study question cannot be answered in an active-controlled trial design; the risks of delaying or foregoing an efficacious vaccine are mitigated; the risks of using a placebo control are justified by the social and public health value of the research; and the research is responsive to local health needs. The four situations are: (1) developing a locally affordable vaccine, (2) evaluating the local safety and efficacy of an existing vaccine, (3) testing a new vaccine when an existing vaccine is considered inappropriate for local use (e.g. based on epidemiologic or demographic factors), and (4) determining the local burden of disease.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24768580"

Participatory data collection involving 52 focus group discussions in 37 village clusters and key informant interviews, a cross-sectional study involving 232 households and a post-vaccination follow up involving 203 households was carried out in 2006-2007 in Narok South district of Kenya. This was to investigate knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices (KAPP) associated with control of CBPP as well as the adverse post-vaccination reactions in animals in order to advice the control policy. The community perceived trans-boundary CBPP threat to their cattle. They had traditional disease coping mechanisms and were conversant with CBPP prevention and control with 49.8% (95%CI: 42.8-56.7%) giving priority to CBPP control. However, 12.9% (95%CI: 9.0-18.1%) of pastoralists had no knowledge of any prevention method and 10.0% (95%CI: 6.5-14.7%) would not know what to do or would do nothing in the event of an outbreak. Although 43.5% (95%CI: 37.1-50.2%) of pastoralists were treating CBPP cases with antimicrobials, 62.5% (95%CI: 52.1-71.7%) of them doubted the effectiveness of the treatments. Pastoralists perceived vaccination to be the solution to CBPP but vaccination was irregular due to unavailability of the vaccine. Vaccination was mainly to control outbreaks rather than preventive and exhibited adverse post-vaccination reactions among 70.4% (95%CI: 63.6-76.5%) of herds and 3.8% (95%CI: 3.5-4.2%) of animals. Consequently, nearly 25.2% (95%CI: 18.5-33.2%) of pastoralists may resist subsequent vaccinations against CBPP. Pastoralists preferred CBPP vaccination at certain times of the year and that it is combined with other vaccinations. In conclusion, pastoralists were not fully aware of the preventive measures and interventions and post-vaccination reactions may discourage subsequent CBPP vaccinations. Consequently there is need for monitoring and management of post vaccination reactions and awareness creation on CBPP prevention and interventions and their merits and demerits. CBPP vaccine was largely unavailable to the pastoralists and the preference of the pastoralists was for vaccination at specified times and vaccine combinations which makes it necessary to avail the vaccine in conformity with the pastoralists preferences. In addition, planning vaccinations should involve pastoralists and neighbouring countries. As the results cannot be generalized, further studies on CBPP control methods and their effectiveness are recommended.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24768437"

To adequately allocate resources for its control, there is a need to assess its impact on cattle producers. The present study estimated the impact of CBPP on pastoralists through analysis of various strategies employed for its control in cattle herds including: preventive vaccination, antimicrobial treatment, slaughter of clinical cases and other combinations of these control strategies. The assessment was based on a loss-expenditure frontier framework to identify a control strategy with minimum cost from both expenditures on control strategies and output losses due to mortalities, reduced milk yield, reduced weight gain and reduced fertility rate. The analysis was undertaken in a stochastic spreadsheet model. The control strategy with minimum cost per herd was preventive vaccination with an estimated cost of US$ 193 (90% CI; 170-215) per 100 cows per year, while slaughter of clinical cases had an estimated cost of US$ 912 (90% CI; 775-1055) per 100 cows per year. The impact of CBPP to the nation was estimated at US$ 7.6 (90% CI; 6.5-8.7) million per year. Yet, if all pastoralists whose cattle are at high risk of infection adopted preventive vaccination, the aggregate national impact would be US$ 3.3 (90% CI; 2.9-3.7) million per year, with savings amounting to US$ 4.3 million through reallocation of control expenditures. The analysis predicted that control of CBPP in Kenya is profitable through preventive vaccination. However, further research is recommended for the technical and financial feasibility of implementing a vaccine delivery system in pastoral areas where CBPP is endemic.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24767814"

Large outbreaks of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB have been described that predominately affect persons with HIV infection. We obtained four closely-related Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains (genotype F15/LAM4/KZN) from an outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, including drug-sensitive, MDR, and XDR clinical isolates. We compared the virulence of these strains in a murine model of aerosol M. tuberculosis infection for four phenotypes: (1) competitive in vivo growth in lung and spleen, (2) non-competitive in vivo growth in lung and spleen, (3) murine survival time, and (4) lung pathology. When mixtures of sensitive, MDR, and XDR KZN strains were aerosolized (competitive model), lung CFUs were similar at 60 days after infection, and spleen CFUs were ordered as follows: sensitive &gt; MDR &gt; XDR. When individual strains were aerosolized (non-competitive model), modest differences in lung and spleen CFUs were observed with the same ordering. C57BL/6, C3H/FeJ, and SCID mice all survived longer after infection with MDR as compared to sensitive strains. SCID mice infected with an XDR strain survived longer than those infected with MDR or sensitive strains. Lung pathology was reduced after XDR TB infection compared to sensitive or MDR TB infection. In summary, increasing degrees of drug resistance were associated with decreasing murine virulence in this collection of KZN strains as measured by all four virulence phenotypes. The predominance of HIV-infected patients in MDR and XDR TB outbreaks may be explained by decreased virulence of these strains in humans.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0094953"

This research sought to predict the impact and cost-effectiveness of an HPV vaccination program in an example low-resource country with a high burden of cervical cancer: Mali, West Africa.METHODS: Novel compartmental mathematical models projected the impact of adolescent HPV vaccination in urban and rural areas of Mali. The models accounted for two high-risk vaccine-types: HPV 16 and 18. We then attached comprehensive real cost and cost-effectiveness estimates.RESULTS: Our models predict that HPV vaccination in Mali will reduce cervical cancer burden by a factor roughly equal to vaccine coverage. A point vaccination program was simulated in a cohort of 333,146 urban and 588,982 rural Malian women, age 10-14. Vaccination of 50% of girls reduced the peak prevalence of HPV 16/18 to 5.0% in the urban setting and 9.6% in the rural setting, down from 11.7% and 22.0%, respectively, with no vaccination. The 50% vaccination scenario averted 1145 cervical cancer deaths in the urban group and 2742 in the rural group. The cost per discounted life-year saved in this scenario was 1030 US dollars (urban) and 725 dollars (rural). The cost per life-year saved was higher at 90% coverage, but was still in the range of a &quot;cost-effective&quot; public health intervention.CONCLUSIONS: This research yielded the most comprehensive real cost estimates of HPV vaccination yet published for sub-Saharan Africa. Our models indicate that HPV vaccination in Mali will be cost-effective when introduced. To maximize the benefit using limited resources, vaccination programs may begin with a target coverage of about 50%. We anticipate that costs of reaching late adopters after the First Vaccinated Wave of vaccination will be higher, but worthwhile.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24731734"

The majority of motorcycles in Uganda are used as motorcycle taxis, better known locally as boda bodas. Research shows that a motorcycle helmet is effective at reducing a rider's risk of death and head injury. As part of the Uganda Helmet Vaccine Initiative (UHVI), researchers collected baseline and formative evaluation data on boda boda operators' helmet attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to inform UHVI activities. Researchers collected data on motorcycle helmet-related attitudes and beliefs through focus group discussions and structured roadside interviews, and researchers conducted roadside observations to collect data on helmet-wearing behaviors. Of the 12,189 motorcycle operators and passengers observed during roadside observations, 30.8% of drivers and &lt;1% of passengers were wearing helmets. The most commonly reported helmet-wearing barriers from the focus group discussions and structured roadside interviews were: (1) 'Helmet is uncomfortable', (2) 'Helmet is too hot', (3) 'Helmet is too expensive', and (4) 'Helmet is of low quality'. Researchers incorporated findings from the formative research into the UHVI campaign to increase motorcycle helmet use. Radio messages addressing helmet comfort and cost were widely aired throughout Kampala, Uganda. In addition, campaign staff held nine boda boda operator workshops, covering approximately 900 operators, in which the facilitator addressed barriers and facilitators to helmet use. Each workshop participant received a high-quality tropical motorcycle helmet. UHVI will continue to use a data-driven approach to future campaign activities.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20/4_suppl/37"

Seventy-two care givers, among them, acceptors and non-acceptors were interviewed in-depth with an interview guide that assessed vaccine acceptance, social and personality factors, and health belief model (HBM) categories in relation to oral polio vaccine (perceived susceptibility, severity, cost barriers, general barriers, benefits, knowledge, and engagement in preventative health behaviours). Community leaders were purposively selected while parents were selected on the basis of availability while ensuring the different attitude to vaccines was covered. Results showed that the HBM framework was found to be appropriate for identifying and distinguishing vaccine acceptors and non-acceptors. In addition, the HBM categories of benefits and susceptibility were found to influence oral polio vaccine acceptance. Second, the opinion of family members about the oral polio vaccine moderated the relationship between number of social ties and vaccine acceptance. Further, oral polio vaccine acceptance was related to outbreaks of paralysis of any sort, but not aggregate scores of other preventative health behaviours. Implications of this study include the investigation of vaccine acceptance in a high risk population.

It is generally agreed that every additional examination entails loss to follow-up and thus to treatment. On the other hand, a lack of resources induces more innovation, as demonstrated over the last half century for short courses of tuberculosis treatment, combined vaccines, and essential and generic drugs. Body weight is the best indicator for monitoring HIV viral load. We sought to determine if it is possible to raise awareness of this measurement that requires simple resources and provides an immediate result, available to healthcare providers in outlying areas. Specifically, we studied the measurement of body fat percentage, which appears to be a promising choice. A trial conducted in Casamance with an impedance meter incorporated into a commercially available scale yielded negative results for this specific task (measurement irregularities due to the condition of the soles of the patients' feet). It seems important to us to study scientifically the interest of this indicator scientifically and its performance in the field pragmatically, with more accessible measurement methods, such as skinfold (a method that has been demonstrated its efficacy in physical anthropology and in the domain of sports).","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24682672"

The objective of this systematic review is to identify and synthesise evidence of socio-economic gradients in health-seeking behaviours related to maternal and child health in Egypt.METHODS: Four databases (Medline, Embase, Global Health and Web of Science) were searched in September 2013 for material published in English from 1992 to 2013 for a combination of terms describing health-seeking behaviours, indicators of socio-economic position and geographical limitation to Egypt. Findings of studies were described and synthesised in a narrative format as meta-analysis was not possible.FINDINGS: Among the 786 references identified, 10 articles met the inclusion criteria. Six studies examined maternal and five studies child health-seeking behaviours (one study examined both). For maternal health, three dimensions of health-seeking behaviour (receipt of any care, type of care and intensity of care) were covered by studies of ante-natal and one dimension (type of care) by analyses of delivery care. For child health, two dimensions of preventive care (coverage of and intensity of immunisation) and three dimensions of curative care (receipt of any care, type and cost of care) were analysed.CONCLUSIONS: Based on two studies of time trends in nationally-representative surveys, socio-economic inequalities in seeking care for basic preventive and curative interventions in maternal and child health appear to have narrowed. Limited evidence of gradients in intensity of maternal preventive and provider selection in child curative care showed that inequalities may have widened. In studies of more geographically and socially homogeneous samples, fewer gradients were identified. Current body of evidence contains numerous limitations and gaps and is insufficient to draw a conclusive summary of such gradients. Improved understanding of SEP gradients is crucial in designing and prioritising interventions to equitably improve maternal and child health outcomes.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0093032"

During April-December 2013, a polio outbreak caused by WPV type 1 (WPV1) of Nigerian origin resulted in 217 cases in or near the Horn of Africa, including 194 cases in Somalia, 14 cases in Kenya, and nine cases in Ethiopia (all cases were reported as of March 10, 2014). During December 14-18, 2013, Kenya conducted the first-ever campaign providing inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) together with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) as part of its outbreak response. The campaign targeted 126,000 children aged ≤59 months who resided in Somali refugee camps and surrounding communities near the Kenya-Somalia border, where most WPV1 cases had been reported, with the aim of increasing population immunity levels to ensure interruption of any residual WPV transmission and prevent spread from potential new importations. A campaign evaluation and vaccination coverage survey demonstrated that combined administration of IPV and OPV in a mass campaign is feasible and can achieve coverage &gt;90%, although combined IPV and OPV campaigns come at a higher cost than OPV-only campaigns and require particular attention to vaccinator training and supervision. Future operational studies could assess the impact on population immunity and the cost-effectiveness of combined IPV and OPV campaigns to accelerate interruption of poliovirus transmission during polio outbreaks and in certain areas in which WPV circulation is endemic.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=mm6311a4"

At the community level, vector control, and antimalarial medicines are the main means for reducing incidence, morbidity, and mortality of malaria. A vaccine not only would bring streamlining in the prevention of morbidity and mortality from malaria but also would be more accessible if integrated with Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI). Globally, an estimated 3.4 billion people are at risk of malaria. Most cases (80%) and deaths (90%) occurred in Africa, and most deaths (77%) are in children under 5 years of age. An effective vaccine has long been envisaged as a valuable addition to the available tools for malaria control. Although research toward the development of malaria vaccines has been pursued since the 1960s, there are no licensed malaria vaccines. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, which targets P. falciparum, has reached phase 3 clinical trials and results are promising. Malaria Vaccine Technology Road Map 2013 has envisaged the world aiming for a licensed vaccine by 2030 that would reduce malaria cases by 75% and be capable of eliminating malaria.

Research on child health has focused on socio-economic factors such as maternal education and access to health care, but little attention has been given to demographic factors and women's autonomy within the household. The purpose of this study was to examine the influences of demographic factors and women's autonomy on the completion of childhood vaccination in rural Ethiopia.METHODS: A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted in a Health and Demographic Survelliance System (HDSS) in southwestern Ethiopia. Data were drawn from a random sample of women with children aged 12-24 months (n = 889). Information on maternal socio-demographic characteristics and household variables were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Vaccination data were obtained from vaccination cards or mother's recall. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association of independent variables with completion of childhood vaccination.RESULTS: Of 889 children aged 12-24 months, 690 (78%) had received at least one vaccination. Only 37% (95% CI, 33.5-39.9) were fully vaccinated. Women's decision making autonomy, number of under-five children in the household, mother's education, use of antenatal care services and proximity to health facility were the main factors associated with full vaccination status.CONCLUSION: Completion of basic vaccination series is very low in the study area. Initiatives that enhance women's autonomy within the household and that promote healthy timing and spacing of pregnancies may help in improving child health through vaccination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.11694/pamj.supp.2014.17.1.3135"

Reports of outbreaks can prompt other countries to impose trade and travel restrictions, which has the potential to discourage reporting. However, reports can also bring medical assistance to contain the outbreak, including access to vaccines.METHODS: We compiled data on reports of meningococcal meningitis to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 54 African countries between 1966 and 2002, a period is marked by two events: first, a large outbreak reported from many countries in 1987 associated with the Hajj that resulted in more stringent requirements for meningitis vaccination among pilgrims; and second, another large outbreak in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1996 that led to a new international mechanism to supply vaccines to countries reporting a meningitis outbreak. We used fixed-effects regression modeling to statistically estimate the effect of external forcing events on the number of countries reporting cases of meningitis to WHO.FINDINGS: We find that the Hajj vaccination requirements started in 1988 were associated with reduced reporting, especially among countries with relatively fewer cases reported between 1966 and 1979. After the vaccine provision mechanism was in place in 1996, reporting among countries that had previously not reported meningitis outbreaks increased.INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that countries may respond to changing incentives to report outbreaks when they can do so. In the long term, these incentives are likely to be more important than surveillance assistance in prompt reporting of outbreaks.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0090290"

Before the widespread introduction of RTS,S vaccines, cost-effectiveness studies are needed to help inform governments in resource-poor settings about how best to prioritize between the new vaccine and existing malaria interventions.METHODS: A Markov model simulated malaria progression in a hypothetical Malawian birth cohort. Parameters were based on published data. Three strategies were compared: no intervention, vaccination at one year, and long-lasting, insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) at birth. Both health service and societal perspectives were explored. Health outcomes were measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted and costed in 2012 US$. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. Three times GDP per capita ($1,095) per DALY averted was used for a cost-effectiveness threshold, whilst one times GDP ($365) was considered 'very cost-effective'.RESULTS: From a societal perspective the vaccine strategy was dominant. It averted 0.11 more DALYs than LLINs and 0.372 more DALYs than the no intervention strategy per person, while costing $10.04 less than LLINs and $59.74 less than no intervention. From a health service perspective the vaccine's ICER was $145.03 per DALY averted, and thus can be considered very cost-effective. The results were robust to changes in all variables except the vaccine and LLINs' duration of efficacy. Vaccines remained cost-effective even at the lowest assumed efficacy levels of 49.6% (mild malaria) and 14.2% (severe malaria), and the highest price of $15. However, from a societal perspective, if the vaccine duration efficacy was set below 2.69 years or the LLIN duration of efficacy was greater than 4.24 years then LLINs became the more cost-effective strategy.CONCLUSION: The results showed that vaccinating Malawian children with RTS,S vaccines was very cost-effective from both a societal and a health service perspective. This result was robust to changes in most variables, including vaccine price and vaccine efficacy, but was sensitive to the duration of efficacy of the vaccine and LLINs. Given the best evidence currently available, vaccines can be considered as a very cost-effective component of Malawi's future malaria control programmes. However, long-term follow-up studies on both interventions are needed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1475-2875-13-66"

Cash transfer programs, microcredit, user fee removal policies and voucher schemes that provide direct or indirect monetary incentives to households have been used for decades in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and more recently in Southeast Asia. Until now, no systematic review of the impact of financial incentives on coverage and uptake of health interventions targeting children under 5 years of age has been conducted. The objective of this review is to provide estimates on the effect of six types of financial incentive programs: (i) Unconditional cash transfers (CT), (ii) Conditional cash transfers (CCT), (iii) Microcredit (MC), (iv) Conditional Microcredit (CMC), (v) Voucher schemes (VS) and (vi) User fee removal (UFR) on the uptake and coverage of health interventions targeting children under the age of five years.METHODS: We conducted systematic searches of a series of databases until September 1st, 2012, to identify relevant studies reporting on the impact of financial incentives on coverage of health interventions and behaviors targeting children under 5 years of age. The quality of the studies was assessed using the CHERG criteria. Meta-analyses were undertaken to estimate the effect when multiple studies meeting our inclusion criteria were available.RESULTS: Our searches resulted in 1671 titles identified 25 studies reporting on the impact of financial incentive programs on 5 groups of coverage indicators: breastfeeding practices (breastfeeding incidence, proportion of children receiving colostrum and early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding for six months and duration of breastfeeding); vaccination (coverage of full immunization, partial immunization and specific antigens); health care use (seeking healthcare when child was ill, visits to health facilities for preventive reasons, visits to health facilities for any reason, visits for health check-up including growth control); management of diarrhoeal disease (ORS use during diarrhea episode, continued feeding during diarrhea, healthcare during diarrhea episode) and other preventive health interventions (iron supplementation, vitamin A, zinc supplementation, preventive deworming). The quality of evidence on the effect of financial incentives on breastfeeding practices was low but seems to indicate a potential positive impact on receiving colostrum, early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding and mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding. There is no effect of financial incentives on immunization coverage although there was moderate quality evidence of conditional cash transfers leading to a small but non-significant increase in coverage of age-appropriate immunization. There was low quality evidence of impact of CCT on healthcare use by children under age 5 (Risk difference: 0.14 [95%CI: 0.03; 0.26]) as well as low quality evidence of an effect of user fee removal on use of curative health services (RD=0.62 [0.41; 0.82]).CONCLUSIONS: Financial incentives may have potential to promote increased coverage of several important child health interventions, but the quality of evidence available is low. The more pronounced effects seem to be achieved by programs that directly removed user fees for access to health services. Some indication of effect were also observed for programs that conditioned financial incentives on participation in health education and attendance to health care visits. This finding suggest that the measured effect may be less a consequence of the financial incentive and more due to conditionalities addressing important informational barriers.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-13-S3-S30"

Screening-based intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for pregnant women, an effective strategy in high-income countries, is often not practical in these settings. Risk factor-based IAP (RFB-IAP) for women with risk factors at delivery has had limited success in preventing neonatal infection. We evaluated the cost and health impacts of maternal GBS vaccination in South Africa.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a decision-analytic model for an annual cohort of pregnant women that simulates the natural history of GBS disease in their infants. We compared four strategies: doing nothing, maternal GBS vaccination, RFB-IAP, and vaccination plus RFB-IAP. Assuming vaccine efficacy varies from 50% to 90% against covered serotypes and 75% of pregnant women are vaccinated, GBS vaccination alone prevents 30-54% of infant GBS cases compared to doing nothing. For vaccine prices between $10 and $30, and mid-range efficacy, its cost ranges from $676 to $2390 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted ($US 2010), compared to doing nothing. RFB-IAP alone, compared to doing nothing, prevents 10% of infant GBS cases at a cost of $240/DALY. Vaccine plus RFB-IAP prevents 48% of cases at a cost of $664-2128/DALY.CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination would substantially reduce the burden of infant GBS disease in South Africa and would be very cost-effective by WHO guidelines. RFB-IAP is also very cost-effective, but prevents only 10% of cases. Vaccination plus RFB-IAP is more effective and more costly than vaccination alone, and consistently very cost-effective.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24530145"

Clinical trials conducted in Kolkata, India, have led to World Health Organization (WHO)-prequalification of Shanchol, an oral cholera vaccine (OCV) with a demonstrated 65% efficacy at 5 years post-vaccination. However, before this vaccine is widely used in endemic areas or in areas at risk of outbreaks, as recommended by the WHO, policymakers will require empirical evidence on its implementation and delivery costs in public health programs. The objective of the present report is to describe the organization, vaccine coverage, and delivery costs of mass vaccination with a new, less expensive OCV (Shanchol) using existing public health infrastructure in Odisha, India, as a model.METHODS: All healthy, non-pregnant residents aged 1 year and above residing in selected villages of the Satyabadi block (Puri district, Odisha, India) were invited to participate in a mass vaccination campaign using two doses of OCV. Prior to the campaign, a de jure census, micro-planning for vaccination and social mobilization activities were implemented. Vaccine coverage for each dose was ascertained as a percentage of the censused population. The direct vaccine delivery costs were estimated by reviewing project expenditure records and by interviewing key personnel.RESULTS: The mass vaccination was conducted during May and June, 2011, in two phases. In each phase, two vaccine doses were given 14 days apart. Sixty-two vaccination booths, staffed by 395 health workers/volunteers, were established in the community. For the censused population, 31,552 persons (61% of the target population) received the first dose and 23,751 (46%) of these completed their second dose, with a drop-out rate of 25% between the two doses. Higher coverage was observed among females and among 6-17 year-olds. Vaccine cost at market price (about US$1.85/dose) was the costliest item. The vaccine delivery cost was $0.49 per dose or $1.13 per fully vaccinated person.DISCUSSION: This is the first undertaken project to collect empirical evidence on the use of Shanchol within a mass vaccination campaign using existing public health program resources. Our findings suggest that mass vaccination is feasible but requires detailed micro-planning. The vaccine and delivery cost is affordable for resource poor countries. Given that the vaccine is now WHO pre-qualified, evidence from this study should encourage oral cholera vaccine use in countries where cholera remains a public health problem.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002629"

Hyalomma detritum) is a two-host domestic endophilic tick of cattle and secondarily other ungulates in the Maghreb region (Africa). This species transmits several pathogens, among which two are major livestock diseases: Theileria annulata and Theileria equi. Various other pathogens are also transmitted by this tick species, such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia bovis. Hyalomma scupense is common in sub-humid and semi-arid areas of several regions in the world, mainly in the Maghreb region. In this region, adults attach to animals during the summer season; larvae and nymphs attach to their hosts during autumn, but there is a regional difference in H. scupense phenology. There is an overlap between immature and adult ticks, leading in some contexts to a dramatic modification of the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases. This tick species attaches preferentially to the posterior udder quarters and thighs. Tick burdens can reach 130 ticks per animal, with a mean of 60 ticks. Calves are 70 times less infested than adult cattle. The control can be implemented through six options: (i) rehabilitation of the farm buildings by roughcasting and smoothing the outer and inner surfaces of the enclosures and walls. This control option should be recommended to be combined with a thorough cleaning of the farm and its surrounding area. With regard to Theileria annulata infection, this control option is the most beneficial. (ii) Acaricide application to animals during the summer season, targeting adults. (iii) Acaricide application during the autumn period for the control of the immature stages. (iv) Acaricide application to the walls: many field veterinarians have suggested this option but it is only partially efficient since nymphs enter deep into the cracks and crevices. It should be used if there is a very high tick burden or if there is a high risk of tick-borne diseases. (v) Manual tick removal: this method is not efficient since the ticks can feed on several other animal species in the farm. This control option can lead to a reduction of the tick population, but not a decrease in tick-borne disease incidence. (vi) Vaccination: this control option consists of injecting the protein Hd86; trials have shown a partial effect on nymphs, with no effect on adult ticks. Combination of two of these control options is recommended in regions where there are high burdens of important tick vectors. Further studies are needed to improve our knowledge on this tick species in the Maghreb region, since the number of published studies on Hyalomma scupense in this region is very limited.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1051/parasite/2014002"

In April 2009 monovalent hepatitis B and combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines were transitioned to a combined pentavalent vaccine. The current schedule offers three doses of PCV and pentavalent, and continues to give children monovalent hepatitis B vaccine at birth. We estimated the overall costs of the Gambian immunisation programme and the incremental costs of introducing pentavalent and the seven-valent PCV.METHODS: Twenty health facilities out of a total of 56 were surveyed. Data collected included number of vaccine doses delivered, staff time spent on vaccine delivery, distance travelled to collect vaccines, and cold chain expansion due to new vaccine introduction. National level data were collected from key informant interviews. Annualised costs were calculated in 2009 US$.RESULTS: With a PCV price of US$7 per dose, the incremental costs of introducing PCV was US$1.6 million, equivalent to US$25 per fully immunised child, with systems costs accounting for US$1.90. The switch to pentavalent vaccine resulted in cost savings of US$0.45 per fully immunised child. Total annual costs increased by 45% after the introduction of the new vaccines, amounting to US$ 3.0 million, or US$45 per fully immunised child.CONCLUSION: Vaccine prices were the most important determinant of total incremental costs and cold chain expansion the biggest cost component of systems costs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24503271"

Immunisation of children has contributed to reducing child morbidity and mortality. In the last two decades, global deaths from vaccine-preventable illnesses have decreased significantly as a result of immunisation. Similar trends have been observed in Ghana following the introduction of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation. The administration of vaccines is based on the period of highest susceptibility among others. Ghana has long used the proportion of children receiving vaccines and the trends in vaccine preventable illness incidence as performance indicators for immunisation. The addition of timeliness of vaccine uptake as an additional performance indicator has been recommended. This study evaluated the timeliness of vaccine uptake among children immunised at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana.METHODS: The study was conducted at the Maternal and Child Health clinic of the hospital between February and March 2012. A representative sample of 259 respondents was selected by simple random sampling. Data collection was by a structured questionnaire and included the examination of Child Health records booklet. Data was entered into a Microsoft Office Access database and analysed using Epi Info Version 3.5.1 2008.RESULTS: The majority of mothers attended antenatal clinics during pregnancy. An overwhelming majority of babies (98.8%) were delivered in a hospital. About 85% of babies were less than 12 months of age. Mean time taken to reach the clinic was 30 minutes. Vaccine uptake was generally timely for initial vaccines. The proportion of children receiving the vaccines later increased with latter vaccines. Overall, 87.3% of babies received vaccines on time with only 5.3% receiving vaccines beyond 28 days of the scheduled date. Children receiving immunisations services in the same facility as they were born were more likely to receive the BCG vaccine on time.CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine uptake is mostly timely among respondents in the study. The BCG vaccine in particular was received on time among children born in the same facility as the immunisation clinic. There is the need to further examine the timeliness of vaccine uptake among children delivered outside health facilities in Ghana.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1471-2458-14-90"

This work describes the public sector nursing workforce likely to be inherited by the counties, and examines the relationships between nursing workforce density and key indicators.METHODS: National nursing deployment data linked to nursing supply data were used and analyzed using statistical and geographical analysis software. Data on nurses deployed in national referral hospitals and on nurses deployed in non-public sector facilities were excluded from main analyses. The densities and characteristics of the public sector nurses across the counties were obtained and examined against an index of county remoteness, and the nursing densities were correlated with five key indicators.RESULTS: Of the 16,371 nurses in the public non-tertiary sector, 76% are women and 53% are registered nurses, with 35% of the nurses aged 40 to 49 years. The nursing densities across counties range from 1.2 to 0.08 per 1,000 population. There are statistically significant associations of the nursing densities with a measure of health spending per capita (P value = 0.0028) and immunization rates (P value = 0.0018). A higher county remoteness index is associated with explaining lower female to male ratio of public sector nurses across counties (P value &lt;0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: An overall shortage of nurses (range of 1.2 to 0.08 per 1,000) in the public sector countrywide is complicated by mal-distribution and varying workforce characteristics (for example, age profile) across counties. All stakeholders should support improvements in human resources information systems and help address personnel shortages and mal-distribution if equitable, quality health-care delivery in the counties is to be achieved.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1478-4491-12-6"

To protect Somali livestock exports from costly import bans used to control the international spread of disease, better certification of livestock health status is required. We performed quantitative risk assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis on different health certification protocols for Somali livestock exports for six transboundary diseases. Examining stock at regional markets alone without port inspection and quarantine was inexpensive but was ineffective for all but contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia and peste des petits ruminants. While extended pre-export quarantine improves detection of infections that cause clinical disease, if biosecurity is suboptimal quarantine provides an opportunity for transmission and increased risk. Clinical examination, laboratory screening and vaccination of animals for key diseases before entry to the quarantine station reduced the risk of an exported animal being infected. If vaccination could be reliably performed weeks before arrival at quarantine its effect would be greatly enhanced. The optimal certification method depends on the disease. Laboratory diagnostic testing was particularly important for detecting infections with limited clinical signs in male animals (only males are exported); for Rift Valley fever (RVF) the probability of detection was 99% or 0% with and without testing. Based on our findings animal inspection and certification at regional markets combined with quarantine inspection and certification would reduce the risk of exporting infected animals and enhance disease control at the regional level. This is especially so for key priority diseases, that is RVF, foot-and-mouth disease and Brucellosis. Increased data collection and testing should be applied at point of production and export.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24462194"

This study seeks to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of a BCG booster vaccine, while accounting for costs of large-scale clinical trials, using the MVA85A vaccine as a case study for estimating potential costs. We conducted a decision analysis from the societal perspective, using a 10-year time frame and a 3% discount rate. We predicted active tuberculosis cases and tuberculosis-related costs for a hypothetical cohort of 960,763 South African newborns (total born in 2009). We compared neonatal vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin alone to vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin plus a booster vaccine at 4 months. We considered booster efficacy estimates ranging from 40% to 70%, relative to bacille Calmette-Guérin alone. We accounted for the costs of Phase III clinical trials. The booster vaccine was assumed to prevent progression to active tuberculosis after childhood infection, with protection decreasing linearly over 10 years. Trial costs were prorated to South Africa's global share of bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination. Vaccination with bacille Calmette-Guérin alone resulted in estimated tuberculosis-related costs of $89.91 million 2012 USD, and 13,610 tuberculosis cases in the birth cohort, over the 10 years. Addition of the booster resulted in estimated cost savings of $7.69-$16.68 million USD, and 2,800-4,160 cases averted, for assumed efficacy values ranging from 40%-70%. A booster tuberculosis vaccine in infancy may result in net societal cost savings as well as fewer active tuberculosis cases, even if efficacy is relatively modest and large scale Phase III studies are required.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0083526"

These and other risk factors, as well as diagnostic strategies, are covered in the first section of this review. Thereafter, the review is focused on the pneumococcus, specifically the major virulence factors of this microbial pathogen and their role in triggering overexuberant inflammatory responses which contribute to the immunopathogenesis of invasive disease. The final section of the review is devoted to a consideration of pharmacological, anti-inflammatory strategies with adjunctive potential in the antimicrobial chemotherapy of CAP. This is focused on macrolides, corticosteroids, and statins with respect to their modes of anti-inflammatory action, current status, and limitations.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1155/2013/490346"

Antenatal care has the potential to reduce maternal morbidity and improve newborns' survival but this benefit may not be realized in sub-Saharan Africa where the attendance and quality of care is declining. We evaluated the association between a mobile phone intervention and antenatal care in a resource-limited setting. We aimed to assess antenatal care in a comprehensive way taking into consideration utilisation of antenatal care as well as content and timing of interventions during pregnancy.METHODS: This study was an open label pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial with primary healthcare facilities in Zanzibar as the unit of randomisation. 2550 pregnant women (1311 interventions and 1239 controls) who attended antenatal care at selected primary healthcare facilities were included at their first antenatal care visit and followed until 42 days after delivery. 24 primary health care facilities in six districts were randomized to either mobile phone intervention or standard care. The intervention consisted of a mobile phone text-message and voucher component. Primary outcome measure was four or more antenatal care visits during pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures were tetanus vaccination, preventive treatment for malaria, gestational age at last antenatal care visit, and antepartum referral.RESULTS: The mobile phone intervention was associated with an increase in antenatal care attendance. In the intervention group 44% of the women received four or more antenatal care visits versus 31% in the control group (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.03-5.55). There was a trend towards improved timing and quality of antenatal care services across all secondary outcome measures although not statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: The wired mothers' mobile phone intervention significantly increased the proportion of women receiving the recommended four antenatal care visits during pregnancy and there was a trend towards improved quality of care with more women receiving preventive health services, more women attending antenatal care late in pregnancy and more women with antepartum complications identified and referred.

However, the best initial sputum sampling strategy for adults with suspected smear-negative or sputum-scarce tuberculosis in primary care is unclear. We compared these two methods of sample acquisition in such patients.METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, we enrolled adults (age ≥18 years) with sputum-scarce or smear-negative suspected tuberculosis from three primary care clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either health-care worker instruction or induction to obtain sputum samples. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had started treatment after 8 weeks in a modified intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes were proportions starting treatment within different time periods, proportion of patients producing sputum for diagnosis, adverse effects, sputum samples' quality, and case detection by diagnostic method. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01545661.FINDINGS: We enrolled 481 patients, of whom 213 were assigned to health-care worker instruction versus 268 assigned to induction. The proportion of patients who started treatment in the 8 weeks after enrolment did not differ significantly between groups (53/213 [25%] vs 73/268 [27%]; OR 0·88, 95% CI 0·57-1·36; p=0·56). A higher proportion of instructed versus induced patients initiated empiric treatment based on clinical and radiography findings (32/53 [60%] vs 28/73 [38%]; p=0·015). An adequate sputum sample ≥1 mL was acquired in a lower proportion of instructed versus induced patients (164/213 [77%] vs 238/268 [89%]; p&lt;0·0001), and culture-based diagnostic yield was lower in instructed versus induced patients (24/213 [11%] vs 51/268 [19%]; p=0·020). However, same-day tuberculosis case detection was similar in both groups using either smear microscopy (13/213 [6%] vs 22/268 [8%]; p=0·38) or Xpert-MTB/RIF assay (13/89 [15%] vs 20/138 [14%]; p=0·98). No serious adverse events occurred in either group; side-effects related to sample acquisition were reported in 32 of 268 (12%) patients who had sputum induction and none who had instruction. Cost per procedure was lower for instructed than for induced patients (US$2·14 vs US$7·88).INTERPRETATION: Although induction provides an adequate sample and a bacteriological diagnosis more frequently than instruction by a health-care worker, it is more costly, does not result in a higher proportion of same-day diagnoses, and-because of widespread empiric treatment-may not result in more patients starting treatment. Thus, health-care worker instruction might be the preferred strategy for initial collection of sputum samples in adults with suspected sputum-scarce or smear-negative tuberculosis in a high burden primary care setting.FUNDING: South African National Research Foundation, European Commission, National Institutes of Health, European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, Discovery Foundation.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S2213-2600(13)70120-6"

Women from different areas in Tanzania were invited by public announcement to cervical cancer screening organized by Ocean Road Cancer Institute (Dar-es-Salaam). A total of 3,767 women were enrolled. Women underwent gynecological examination with collection of cervical cells for conventional cytological examination, and swab for HPV-DNA detection (Hybrid-Capture2) and genotyping (LiPAv2 test). Subsequently VIA was performed. The participants were also tested for HIV. HPV16, HPV52 and HPV18 were the three most common HR HPV types among women with HSIL+ cytology with prevalences of 42.9, 35.7 and 28.6%, respectively, in HIV positive women which was higher than among HIV negative women (30.2, 21.9 and 16.7%). A total of 4.5% of the women were VIA positive, and VIA showed a low sensitivity compared to HPV-testing for detection of HSIL+. The sensitivity of VIA varied with staff VIA experience, HIV status and age. Vaccines including HPV16, HPV52 and HPV18 will likely reduce the number of HSIL+ cases independently of HIV status. The frequency of HSIL+ was high among HIV positive women, emphasizing the importance of establishing a screening program which also reaches HIV positive women. Our results highlight the importance of continuous training of staff performing VIA, and also point to the need for other screening methods such as HPV-testing at low cost.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24391021"

DRC has introduced a series of reforms to move the country toward performance-based management and program budgets.METHODS: The objectives of the study were to: (i) describe the budget process norm, (ii) analyze the budget process in practice and associated bottlenecks at each of its phases, and (iii) collect suggestions made by the actors involved to improve the situation. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through: a review of published and gray literature, and individual interviews.RESULTS: Bottlenecks in the budget process and disbursement of funds for immunization are one of the causes of limited domestic resources for the program. Critical bottlenecks include: excessive use of off-budget procedures; limited human resources and capacity; lack of motivation; interference from ministries with the standard budget process; dependency toward the development partner's disbursements schedule; and lack of budget implementation tracking. Results show that the health sector's mobilization rate was 59% in 2011. For the credit line specific to immunization program activities, the mobilization rate for the national Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) was 26% in 2011 and 43% for vaccines (2010). The main bottleneck for the EPI budget line (2011) and vaccine budget line (2011) occurs at the authorization phase.DISCUSSION: Budget process bottlenecks identified in the analysis lead to a low mobilization rate for the immunization program. The bottlenecks identified show that a poor flow of funds causes an insufficient percentage of already allocated resources to reach various health system levels.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24384055"

The vaccine was well tolerated and induced robust antibody responses in mice, which neutralized the biological activity of IL-1β, as shown both in cellular assays and in challenge experiments in vivo. Antibody titers were long lasting but reversible over time and not associated with the development of potentially harmful T cell responses against IL-1β. Neutralization of IL-1β by vaccine-induced antibodies had no influence on the immune responses of mice to Listeria monocytogenes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a diet-induced model of type 2 diabetes, immunized mice showed improved glucose tolerance, which was mediated by improved insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells. Hence, immunization with IL-1β conjugated to virus-like particles has the potential to become a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective therapy for the prevention and long-term treatment of type 2 diabetes.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1038/mtm.2014.48"

The effect of socio-cultural differences on health-seeking behaviour has been identified in the literature as the main cause of the disparity. Our study analyses the role of supply-side determinants, particularly access to services, in causing these disparities.METHODS: Using routine government data, we compared supply-side determinants of access in two Northern states with two Southern states. The states were identified using criteria-based purposive selection such that the comparisons were made between a low-coverage state in the South and a low-coverage state in the North as well as between a high-coverage state in the South and a high-coverage state in the North.RESULTS: Human resources and commodities at routine immunization service delivery points were generally insufficient for service delivery in both geographical regions. While disparities were evident between individual states irrespective of regional location, compared to the South, residents in Northern Nigeria were more likely to have vaccination service delivery points located within a 5 km radius of their settlements.CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that regional supply-side disparities are not apparent, reinforcing the earlier reported socio-cultural explanations for disparities in routine immunization service uptake between Northern and Southern Nigeria. Nonetheless, improving routine immunisation coverage services require that there are available human resources and that health facilities are equitably distributed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0144876"

The study aims to account for both the impact of the vaccine among girls who are HIV-positive (HIV+) as well as HIV-negative (HIV-) population.METHODS: A previously published Markov cohort model was adapted to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of a HPV vaccination programme in girls aged 12 years (N = 527 900) using the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine from a public payer perspective. Two subpopulations were considered: HIV- and HIV+ women. Each population followed the HPV natural history with different transition probabilities. Model input data were obtained from the literature, local databases and Delphi panel. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 5 %. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the evaluation.RESULTS: Implementation of the AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine in combination with current cytological screening in South African girls could prevent up to 8 869 CC cases and 5 436 CC deaths over the lifetime of a single cohort. Without discounting, this HPV vaccine is dominant over screening alone; with discounting, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is ZAR 81 978 (South African Rand) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. HPV vaccination can be considered cost-effective based on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended threshold (3 x gross domestic product/capita = ZAR 200 293). In a scenario with a hypothetical targeted vaccination in a HIV+ subpopulation alone, the modelled outcomes suggest that HPV vaccination is still cost-effective, although the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increases to ZAR 102 479. Results were sensitive to discount rate, vaccine efficacy, HIV incidence and mortality rates, and HPV-related disease transition probabilities.CONCLUSIONS: The AS04-adjuvanted HPV-16/18 vaccine can be considered cost-effective in a South African context although the cost-effectiveness is expected to be lower in the HIV+ subpopulation than in the overall female population. With improved access to HIV treatment, the HIV mortality and incidence rates are likely to be reduced, which could improve cost-effectiveness of the vaccination programme in South Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12879-015-1295-z"

This paper provides an overview of injury estimates from the 2013 update of GBD, with detailed information on incidence, mortality, DALYs and rates of change from 1990 to 2013 for 26 causes of injury, globally, by region and by country.METHODS: Injury mortality was estimated using the extensive GBD mortality database, corrections for ill-defined cause of death and the cause of death ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was based on inpatient and outpatient data sets, 26 cause-of-injury and 47 nature-of-injury categories, and seven follow-up studies with patient-reported long-term outcome measures.RESULTS: In 2013, 973 million (uncertainty interval (UI) 942 to 993) people sustained injuries that warranted some type of healthcare and 4.8 million (UI 4.5 to 5.1) people died from injuries. Between 1990 and 2013 the global age-standardised injury DALY rate decreased by 31% (UI 26% to 35%). The rate of decline in DALY rates was significant for 22 cause-of-injury categories, including all the major injuries.CONCLUSIONS: Injuries continue to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed and developing world. The decline in rates for almost all injuries is so prominent that it warrants a general statement that the world is becoming a safer place to live in. However, the patterns vary widely by cause, age, sex, region and time and there are still large improvements that need to be made.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=injuryprev-2015-041616"

Incentives were distributed during central-point rabies vaccination clinics in northern Tanzania to quantify their effect on owner participation. In villages where incentives were handed out participation increased, with an average of 34 more dogs being vaccinated. Through economies of scale, this represents a reduction in the cost-per-dog of $0.47. This represents the price-threshold under which the cost of the incentive used must fall to be economically viable. Additionally, vaccination coverage levels were determined in ten villages through the gold-standard village-wide census technique, as well as through two cheaper and quicker methods (randomized household questionnaire and the transect survey). Cost data were also collected. Both non-gold standard methods were found to be accurate when puppies were included in the calculations, although the transect survey and the household questionnaire survey over- and under-estimated the coverage respectively. Given that additional demographic data can be collected through the household questionnaire survey, and that its estimate of coverage is more conservative, we recommend this method. Despite the use of incentives the average vaccination coverage was below the 70% threshold for eliminating rabies. We discuss the reasons and suggest solutions to improve coverage. Given recent international targets to eliminate rabies, this study provides valuable and timely data to help improve mass dog vaccination programs in Africa and elsewhere.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004221"

However, despite high HIV burden in sub-Saharan Africa, testing coverage is low, particularly among young adults and men. Community-based HIV testing and counselling (testing outside of health facilities) has the potential to reduce coverage gaps, but the relative impact of different modalities is not well assessed. We conducted a systematic review of HIV testing modalities, characterizing community (home, mobile, index, key populations, campaign, workplace and self-testing) and facility approaches by population reached, HIV positivity, CD4 count at diagnosis and linkage. Of 2,520 abstracts screened, 126 met eligibility criteria. Community HIV testing and counselling had high coverage and uptake and identified HIV-positive people at higher CD4 counts than facility testing. Mobile HIV testing reached the highest proportion of men of all modalities examined (50%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 47-54%) and home with self-testing reached the highest proportion of young adults (66%, 95% CI = 65-67%). Few studies evaluated HIV testing for key populations (commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men), but these interventions yielded high HIV positivity (38%, 95% CI = 19-62%) combined with the highest proportion of first-time testers (78%, 95% CI = 63-88%), indicating service gaps. Community testing with facilitated linkage (for example, counsellor follow-up to support linkage) achieved high linkage to care (95%, 95% CI = 87-98%) and antiretroviral initiation (75%, 95% CI = 68-82%). Expanding home and mobile testing, self-testing and outreach to key populations with facilitated linkage can increase the proportion of men, young adults and high-risk individuals linked to HIV treatment and prevention, and decrease HIV burden.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=nature16044"

Plants have the potential to mass-produce pharmaceutical products with less cost than traditional methods. Tobacco-derived antibodies have been tested and used to combat the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Genetically engineered immunoadhesin (DPP4-Fc) produced in green plants has been shown to be able to bind to MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), preventing the virus from infecting lung cells. Biosafety concerns (such as pollen contamination and immunogenicity of plant-specific glycans) and costly downstream extraction and purification requirements, however, have hampered PMF production from moving from the laboratory to industrial application.

While national benchmarking has become more common, such work at subnational levels is rare. The timely and rigorous measurement of local levels and trends in key health interventions and outcomes is vital to identifying areas of progress and detecting early signs of stalled or declining health system performance. Previous studies have yet to provide a comprehensive assessment of Uganda's maternal and child health (MCH) landscape at the subnational level.METHODS: By triangulating a number of different data sources - population censuses, household surveys, and administrative data - we generated regional estimates of 27 key MCH outcomes, interventions, and socioeconomic indicators from 1990 to 2011. After calculating source-specific estimates of intervention coverage, we used a two-step statistical model involving a mixed-effects linear model as an input to Gaussian process regression to produce regional-level trends. We also generated national-level estimates and constructed an indicator of overall intervention coverage based on the average of 11 high-priority interventions.RESULTS: National estimates often veiled large differences in coverage levels and trends across Uganda's regions. Under-5 mortality declined dramatically, from 163 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 85 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2011, but a large gap between Kampala and the rest of the country persisted. Uganda rapidly scaled up a subset of interventions across regions, including household ownership of insecticide-treated nets, receipt of artemisinin-based combination therapies among children under 5, and pentavalent immunization. Conversely, most regions saw minimal increases, if not actual declines, in the coverage of indicators that required multiple contacts with the health system, such as four or more antenatal care visits, three doses of oral polio vaccine, and two doses of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy. Some of the regions with the lowest levels of overall intervention coverage in 1990, such as North and West Nile, saw marked progress by 2011; nonetheless, sizeable disparities remained between Kampala and the rest of the country. Countrywide, overall coverage increased from 40% in 1990 to 64% in 2011, but coverage in 2011 ranged from 57% to 70% across regions.CONCLUSIONS: The MCH landscape in Uganda has, for the most part, improved between 1990 and 2011. Subnational benchmarking quantified the persistence of geographic health inequalities and identified regions in need of additional health systems strengthening. The tracking and analysis of subnational health trends should be conducted regularly to better guide policy decisions and strengthen responsiveness to local health needs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12916-015-0518-x"

The challenge of simultaneously expanding appropriate access to antimicrobials, while restricting inappropriate access, particularly to expensive, newer generation antimicrobials, is unique in global health and requires new approaches to financing and delivering health care and a one-health perspective on the connections between pathogen transmission in animals and humans.

World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that countries without vaccination programmes to assess the burden of rubella infection and CRS. However; in many African countries there is limited data on epidemiology of rubella infection and CRS. This review was undertaken to assess the serological markers and genotypes of rubella virus on the African continent in order to ascertain the gap for future research.FINDINGS: A systematic search of original literatures from different electronic databases using search terms such as 'rubella' plus individual African countries such as 'Tanzania', 'Kenya', 'Nigeria' etc. and different populations such as 'children', 'pregnant women' etc. in different combinations was performed. Articles from countries with rubella vaccination programmes, outbreak data and case reports were excluded. Data were entered in a Microsoft Excel sheet and analyzed. A total of 44 articles from 17 African countries published between 2002 and 2014 were retrieved; of which 36 were eligible and included in this review. Of all population tested, the natural immunity of rubella was found to range from 52.9 to 97.9 %. In these countries, the prevalence of susceptible pregnant women ranged from 2.1 to 47.1 %. Rubella natural immunity was significantly higher among pregnant women than in general population (P &lt; 0.001). Acute rubella infection was observed to be as low as 0.3 % among pregnant women to 45.1 % among children. All studies did not ascertain the age-specific prevalence, thus it was difficult to calculate the rate of infection with increase in age. Only two articles were found to report on rubella genotypes. Of 15 strains genotyped; three rubella virus genotypes were found to circulate in four African countries.CONCLUSION: Despite variations in serological assays, the seroprevalence of IgG rubella antibodies in Africa is high with a substantial number of women of childbearing age being susceptible to rubella infection. Standardized sero-epidemiological data in various age groups as well as CRS data are important to implement cost-effective vaccination campaigns and control strategies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s13104-015-1711-x"

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the evidence of influenza economic burden assessment methods in LMIC and to quantify the economic consequences of influenza disease in these countries, including broader opportunity costs in terms of impaired social progress and economic development.METHODS: We conducted an all language literature search across 5 key databases using an extensive list of key words for the time period 1950-2013. We included studies which explored direct costs (medical and non-medical), indirect costs (productivity losses), and broader economic impact in LMIC associated with different influenza outcomes such as confirmed seasonal influenza infection, influenza-like illnesses, and pandemic influenza.RESULTS: We included 62 full-text studies in English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese languages, mostly from the countries of Latin American and the Caribbean and East Asia and Pacific with pertinent cost data found in 39 papers. Estimates for direct and indirect costs were the highest in Latin American and the Caribbean. Compared to high-income economies, direct costs in LMIC were lower and productivity losses higher. Evidence on broader impact of influenza included impact on the wider national economy, security dimension, medical insurance policy, legal frameworks, distributional impact, and investment flows.CONCLUSION: The economic burden of influenza in LMIC encompasses multiple dimensions such as direct costs to the health service and households, indirect costs due to productivity losses as well as broader detriments to the wider economy. Evidence from sub-Saharan Africa and in pregnant women remains very limited. Heterogeneity of methods used to estimate cost components makes data synthesis challenging.

We propose that even such successful advances are insufficient for many emergent diseases. We review work hypothesizing that Makona, phenotypically similar to much smaller outbreaks, emerged out of shifts in land use brought about by neoliberal economics. The epidemiological consequences demand a new science that explicitly addresses the foundational processes underlying multispecies health, including the deep-time histories, cultural infrastructure, and global economic geographies driving disease emergence. The approach, for instance, reverses the standard public health practice of segregating emergency responses and the structural context from which outbreaks originate. In Ebola's case, regional neoliberalism may affix the stochastic &quot;friction&quot; of ecological relationships imposed by the forest across populations, which, when above a threshold, keeps the virus from lining up transmission above replacement. Export-led logging, mining, and intensive agriculture may depress such functional noise, permitting novel spillovers larger forces of infection. Mature outbreaks, meanwhile, can continue to circulate even in the face of efficient vaccines. More research on these integral explanations is required, but the narrow albeit welcome success of the vaccine may be used to limit support of such a program.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26581892"

Ebola viruses mainly target the hepatocytes, endothelial, and macrophage-rich lymphoid tissues and are characterized by immune suppression and a systemic inflammatory response that causes impairment of the vascular, coagulation, and immune systems. This impairment leads to multifocal necrosis and multi organ failure, and thus, in some ways, resembling septic shock. Currently, neither a specific treatment nor a vaccine licensed for use in humans is available. This review is focused on general characteristic of Ebola viruses, its pathogenesis, immunological response of host, and recent approaches for vaccine development against EVD.

After the major group A meningococcal meningitis epidemics in 1996-1997 (250,000 cases and 25,000 deaths), African ministers of health declared the prevention of meningitis a high priority and asked the World Health Organization (WHO) for help in developing better immunization strategies to eliminate meningitis epidemics in Africa.METHODS: WHO accepted the challenge and created a project called Epidemic Meningitis Vaccines for Africa (EVA) that served as an organizational framework for external consultants, PATH, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). Consultations were initiated with major vaccine manufacturers. EVA commissioned a costing study/business plan for the development of new group A or A/C conjugate vaccines and explored the feasibility of developing these products as a public-private partnership. Representatives from African countries were consulted. They confirmed that the development of conjugate vaccines was a priority and provided information on preferred product characteristics. In parallel, a strategy for successful introduction was also anticipated and discussed.RESULTS: The expert consultations recommended that a group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine be developed and introduced into the African meningitis belt. The results of the costing study indicated that the &quot;cost of goods&quot; to develop a group A - containing conjugate vaccine in the United States would be in the range of US$0.35-$1.35 per dose, depending on composition (A vs A/C), number of doses/vials, and presentation. Following an invitation from BMGF, a proposal was submitted in the spring of 2001.CONCLUSIONS: In June 2001, BMGF awarded a grant of US$70 million to create the Meningitis Vaccine Project (MVP) as a partnership between PATH and WHO, with the specific goal of developing an affordable MenA conjugate vaccine to eliminate MenA meningitis epidemics in Africa. EVA is an example of the use of WHO as an important convening instrument to facilitate new approaches to address major public health problems.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=civ593"

Impact projections and cost-effectiveness estimates for longer timeframes than the trial follow-up and across a range of settings are needed to inform policy recommendations. We aimed to assess the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of routine use of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine in African settings.METHODS: We compared four malaria transmission models and their predictions to assess vaccine cost-effectiveness and impact. We used trial data for follow-up of 32 months or longer to parameterise vaccine protection in the group aged 5-17 months. Estimates of cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted were calculated over a 15 year time horizon for a range of levels of Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence in 2-10 year olds (PfPR2-10; range 3-65%). We considered two vaccine schedules: three doses at ages 6, 7·5, and 9 months (three-dose schedule, 90% coverage) and including a fourth dose at age 27 months (four-dose schedule, 72% coverage). We estimated cost-effectiveness in the presence of existing malaria interventions for vaccine prices of US$2-10 per dose.FINDINGS: In regions with a PfPR2-10 of 10-65%, RTS,S/AS01 is predicted to avert a median of 93,940 (range 20,490-126,540) clinical cases and 394 (127-708) deaths for the three-dose schedule, or 116,480 (31,450-160,410) clinical cases and 484 (189-859) deaths for the four-dose schedule, per 100,000 fully vaccinated children. A positive impact is also predicted at a PfPR2-10 of 5-10%, but there is little impact at a prevalence of lower than 3%. At $5 per dose and a PfPR2-10 of 10-65%, we estimated a median incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared with current interventions of $30 (range 18-211) per clinical case averted and $80 (44-279) per DALY averted for the three-dose schedule, and of $25 (16-222) and $87 (48-244), respectively, for the four-dose schedule. Higher ICERs were estimated at low PfPR2-10 levels.INTERPRETATION: We predict a significant public health impact and high cost-effectiveness of the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine across a wide range of settings. Decisions about implementation will need to consider levels of malaria burden, the cost-effectiveness and coverage of other malaria interventions, health priorities, financing, and the capacity of the health system to deliver the vaccine.FUNDING: PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative; Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation; Global Good Fund; Medical Research Council; UK Department for International Development; GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance; WHO.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0140-6736(15)00725-4"

We assessed the impact of actual VMMC scale-up to date and evaluated the impact of potential alterations to the program to enhance program efficiency, through prioritization of subpopulations.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We implemented a recently developed analytical approach: the age-structured mathematical (ASM) model and accompanying three-level conceptual framework to assess the impact of VMMC as an intervention. By September 2014, 364,185 males were circumcised, an initiative that is estimated to avert 40,301 HIV infections by 2025. Through age-group prioritization, the number of VMMCs needed to avert one infection (effectiveness) ranged between ten (20-24 age-group) and 53 (45-49 age-group). The cost per infection averted ranged between $811 (20-24 age-group) and $5,518 (45-49 age-group). By 2025, the largest reductions in HIV incidence rate (up to 27%) were achieved by prioritizing 10-14, 15-19, or 20-24 year old. The greatest program efficiency was achieved by prioritizing 15-24, 15-29, or 15-34 year old. Prioritizing males 13-29 year old was programmatically efficient, but slightly inferior to the 15-24, 15-29, or 15-34 age groups. Through geographic prioritization, effectiveness varied from 9-12 VMMCs per infection averted across provinces. Through risk-group prioritization, effectiveness ranged from one (highest sexual risk-group) to 60 (lowest sexual risk-group) VMMCs per infection averted.CONCLUSION: The current VMMC program plan in Zimbabwe is targeting an efficient and impactful age bracket (13-29 year old), but program efficiency can be improved by prioritizing a subset of males for demand creation and service availability. The greatest program efficiency can be attained by prioritizing young sexually active males and males whose sexual behavior puts them at higher risk for acquiring HIV.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0140818"

Although FP is a cost-effective public health intervention, there is a paucity of data on knowledge and use of modern FP in FCs. This study determined knowledge and use of modern FP methods in FCs of Uganda.METHODS: Data were accrued from a 12-month follow up of 1,688 HIV-uninfected individuals, 18-49 years from 8 FCs along Lake Victoria, between September 2011 and March 2013. Data on knowledge and use of modern FP were collected through a semi-structured questionnaire. Prevalence Risk Ratios with corresponding 95% CIs were used to determine factors associated with Modern FP knowledge and use.RESULTS: The mean age was 31.4 years, with nearly half (48.8%) being females while more than half (58.6%) had attained up to primary education level. Knowledge of modern FP was high, 87.5% (1477/1688); significantly higher among females [adj. PRR = 4.84 (95% CI; 3.08, 7.61)], among older respondents (25-29 years) [adj. PRR = 1.83 (95% CI; 1.12, 2.99)] compared to younger ones (18-24 years) and among those conducting business [adj. PRR = 2.42(95% CI; 1.02, 5.74)] relative to those primarily in fishing. Just over a third (35.2%, 595/1688) reported use of at least one modern FP method. Use of modern FP methods was significantly higher among females [adj. PRR = 2.04 (95% CI; 1.56, 2.65, and among those reporting multiple sexual partnerships [adj. PRR = 2.12, 95% CI; 1.63, 2.76)]. Nonuse of modern methods was mostly due to desire for more children (30.6%), fear of side effects (12.2%) and partner refusal (5.2%).CONCLUSION: Despite their high knowledge of FP, FCs have low use of modern FP methods. Key barriers to use of modern FP methods were high fertility desires, fear of perceived side effects and partner refusal of methods.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0141531"

To achieve these objectives, we developed a Trial Outcomes Map for vaccination communication.STUDY DESIGN: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for trials of childhood vaccination communication interventions, extracting verbatim all outcome information from included trials. Through thematic grouping, we categorized outcomes based on conceptual similarities, forming a Trial Outcomes Map.RESULTS: We identified 112 relevant trials containing 209 outcomes. Thematic analysis revealed three overarching Outcome Categories: consumer-, vaccination-, and health system-related outcomes. These categories contain 21 Outcome Types (eg, &quot;knowledge,&quot; &quot;cost&quot;), measured using 66 different Outcome Variables. Vaccination outcomes were measured most frequently and health system-related outcomes least frequently. Consumer outcomes are increasingly measured in more recent trials.CONCLUSION: The number of measures used for the same outcomes complicates data synthesis and interpretation. Despite recent trends toward including consumer outcomes, intermediate outcome measurement is lacking, hampering understanding of how and why vaccination communication interventions do or do not work. This Map may improve outcome consistency in future trials and will contribute to a forthcoming core outcome set.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26472286"

Although an efficient vaccine is available and has been used since the early 1940s, sylvatic YFV transmission still occurs in forested areas where anthropogenic actions are present, such as mineral extraction, rearing livestock and agriculture, and ecological tourism. In this context, two distinct techniques based on the RT-PCR derived method have been previously developed, however both methods are expensive due to the use of thermo cyclers and labeled probes. We developed isothermal genome amplification, which is a rapid, sensitive, specific and low cost molecular approach for YFV genome detection. This assay used a set of degenerate primers designed for the NS1 gene and was able to amplify, within 30 min in isothermal conditions, the YFV 17D vaccine strain derived from an African wild prototype strain (Asibi), as well as field strains from Brazil, other endemic countries from South and Central America, and the Caribbean. The generic RT-LAMP assay could be helpful for YFV surveillance in field and rapid response during outbreaks in endemic areas.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26459206"

Children infected with HIV after 6 weeks often remain undiagnosed because of poor implementation of post-weaning and final outcome 18-month HIV testing. The World Health Organization recommends a screening HIV rapid test (HRT) in HIV-exposed infants at the 9-month immunisation visit to exclude postnatal infection, with a confirmatory HIV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test if the HRT is positive.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of substituting this recommendation for the post-weaning HIV testing recommended by SA guidelines.METHODS: Rates of seroreversion and probability of infection at 9 months of age were applied to a theoretical population of 100 HIV-exposed infants, uninfected at birth and breastfed for 1 year with antiretroviral prophylaxis. Nine scenarios were developed and the number of HIV PCRs saved compared with current guidelines was calculated.RESULTS: Nine-month testing using the HRT reduced the number of follow-up PCR tests done in all scenarios by &amp;gt;50%, with differences ranging from 51% to 59% and 81% to 89% for low and high seroreversion rates, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Nine-month testing using HRT would increase identification and early treatment of HIV-infected infants, improve monitoring of postnatal transmission rates, and reduce the number of HIV PCR tests done with resultant cost saving. Training of healthcare workers implementing HRT would be required. Ongoing efforts to improve implementation and monitoring of testing at 9 and 18 months will be essential.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26428977"

The full childhood immunization coverage in many parts of Ethiopia is far from optimal. Hence, the main objective of this study was to assess factors associated with childhood full immunization in Ethiopia.METHODS: The data source for this study was the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. Multilevel regression analysis techniques were used to conduct the analysis. Accordingly a two level multilevel regression analysis model was built with individuals (level 1) nested with in communities (level 2).RESULTS: A total of 4983 children aged 12-59 months nested within 520 clusters were included in the analysis. According to the analysis results, in the year 2011, 26 % of children less than 5 years old were fully immunized in Ethiopia. Being born at health institutions, higher level of maternal education, media exposure, region of residence and residing in communities possessing higher maternal antenatal care services utilization were positively associated with childhood full immunization. In contrary to this, the number children aged less than 5 years in the household was negatively associated with childhood full immunization. The random effect results indicated that 21 % of the variation among the communities was due to community level factors.CONCLUSIONS: It was found that various individual and contextual factors were associated with childhood full immunization. In addition, significant community level variation remains after having controlled individual and community level factors which is an indicative of a need for further research on community level factors. Hence, utilizing multilevel modeling in determining the effect of both individual and contextual level factors simultaneously had brought an important output which may help planners, policy and decision makers to emphasize on both individuals and communities in which they live.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12889-015-2315-z"

We included studies with laboratory confirmation of influenza, well-defined catchment populations, case definitions used to sample patients for testing and a description of the laboratory methods used for influenza testing. Studies with or without any adjustments on the incidence rates were included.RESULTS: Ten studies reporting the incidence of medically-attended and non-medically attended influenza were reviewed. For all age groups, the influenza positive proportion ranged from 5-10% among hospitalized patients, and 5-27% among all medically-attended patients (a combination of in- and outpatients). The adjusted incidence rate of hospitalizations with influenza among children &lt; 5 years ranged from 2.7-4.7 per 1,000 [5.7 per 1,000 in children &lt; 6 months old], and were 7-10 times higher compared to persons aged ≥ 5 years.

Only by mapping the location and type of all sprayable structures can IRS operations be planned, estimates of spray coverage determined, and targeted delivery of IRS to specific locations be achieved. Previously, field-based enumeration has been used to guide IRS campaigns, however, this approach is costly, time-consuming and difficult to scale. As a result, field-based enumeration typically fails to map all structures in a given area, making estimations less reliable and reducing the enumerated coverage.METHODS: Using open source satellite imagery and Geographic Information System software, satellite enumeration was conducted to guide IRS operations in 15 districts (91,302 km(2)) in northern Zambia during the 2014 spray season. Cost of satellite enumeration was compared to standard enumeration. Enumerated households were sampled to estimate sprayable surface area and wall type from the satellite enumeration using linear and logistic regression, respectively.RESULTS: In comparison to the traditional field-based enumeration procedure, satellite-based enumeration was 22 times faster, and 10 times less costly. An estimated 98 % of the satellite enumerated buildings correctly classified roof type. Predicted surface area of each household correlated at a value of 0.91 with measured surface area of each household.CONCLUSION: For IRS campaigns, high quality and high coverage enumeration data aid in planning, through informed insecticide procurement. Through the identification of geographical areas and populations to target, enumeration data guide operations and assist monitoring and evaluation of IRS through the unbiased estimation of coverage achieved. Satellite enumeration represents a quick, cheap and accurate system to provide these data, and has potential applications beyond IRS for delivery of other targeted or non-targeted interventions (e.g. net distributions, mass drug administration, immunization campaigns, or even sampling frames for field studies).","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12936-015-0831-z"

Data were collected using questionnaires from 293 farmers in three different production systems. The influence of perceptions on the intentions to implement control measures were analyzed using binary logistic regression. The effect of socio-demographic and husbandry variables on perceptions that were found to significantly influence the intentions were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. Almost all farmers (99%) intended to implement FMD vaccination free of charge. The majority of farmers in the pastoral (94%) and market oriented (92%) systems also had the intention to implement vaccination with charge but only 42% of the crop-livestock mixed farmers had the intention to do so. Only 2% of pastoral and 18% of crop-livestock mixed farmers had the intention to implement herd isolation and animal movement restriction continuously. These proportions increased to 11% for pastoral and 50% for crop-livestock mixed farmers when the measure is applied only during an outbreak. The majority of farmers in the market oriented system (&gt;80%) had the intention to implement herd isolation and animal movement restriction measure, both continuously and during an outbreak. Among the HBM perception constructs, perceived barrier was found to be the only significant predictor of the intention to implement vaccination. Perceived susceptibility, perceived benefit and perceived barrier were the significant predictors of the intention for herd isolation and animal movement restriction measure. In turn, the predicting perceived barrier on vaccination control varied significantly with the production system and the age of farmers. The significant HBM perception predictors on herd isolation and animal movement restriction control were significantly influenced only by the type of production system. The results of this study indicate that farmers' intentions to apply FMD control measures are variable among production systems, an insight which is relevant in the development of future control programs. Promotion programs aimed at increasing farmers' motivation to participate in FMD control by charged vaccination or animal movement restriction should give attention to the perceived barriers influencing the intentions to apply these measures.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0138363"

The impact and cost-effectiveness were estimated for condom promotion, PrEP and/or TasP, compared with a baseline where antiretroviral therapy (ART) was offered according to 2010 national guidelines (CD4 &lt;350 cells/μl) to all HIV-positive partners. The impact was additionally compared with a baseline of current ART coverage (35% of those with CD4 &lt;350 cells/μl). Full costs (in US $2012) of programme introduction and implementation were estimated from a provider perspective.RESULTS: Substantial benefits came from scaling up ART to all HIV-positive partners according to 2010 national guidelines, with additional smaller benefits of providing TasP, PrEP or condom promotion. Compared with a baseline of offering ART to all HIV-positive partners at the 2010 national guidelines, condom promotion was the most cost-effective strategy [US $1206/disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY)], the next most cost-effective intervention was to additionally give TasP to HIV-positive partners (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio US $1607/DALY), followed by additionally giving PrEP to HIV-negative partners until their HIV-positive partners initiate ART (US $7870/DALY). When impact was measured in terms of infections averted, PrEP with condom promotion prevented double the number of infections as condom promotion alone.CONCLUSIONS: The first priority intervention for serodiscordant couples in Nigeria should be scaled up ART access for HIV-positive partners. Subsequent incremental benefits are greatest with condom promotion and TasP, followed by PrEP.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/QAD.0000000000000798"

In particular, under-five morbidity and mortality have increased in recent decades due to childhood diarrhoea, cough and fever. Understanding the geographic distribution of such diseases and their relationships to potential risk factors can be invaluable for cost effective intervention.METHODS: Bayesian semi-parametric regression models were used to quantify the spatial risk of childhood diarrhoea, fever and cough, as well as associations between childhood diseases and a range of factors, after accounting for spatial correlation between neighbouring areas. Such semi-parametric regression models allow joint analysis of non-linear effects of continuous covariates, spatially structured variation, unstructured heterogeneity, and other fixed effects on childhood diseases. Modelling and inference made use of the fully Bayesian approach via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques. The analysis was based on data derived from the 1999, 2005/6 and 2010/11 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Surveys (ZDHS).RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that until recently, sex of child had little or no significant association with childhood diseases. However, a higher proportion of male than female children within a given province had a significant association with childhood cough, fever and diarrhoea. Compared to their counterparts in rural areas, children raised in an urban setting had less exposure to cough, fever and diarrhoea across all the survey years with the exception of diarrhoea in 2010. In addition, the link between sanitation, parental education, antenatal care, vaccination and childhood diseases was found to be both intuitive and counterintuitive. Results also showed marked geographical differences in the prevalence of childhood diarrhoea, fever and cough. Across all the survey years Manicaland province reported the highest cases of childhood diseases. There is also clear evidence of significant high prevalence of childhood diseases in Mashonaland than in Matabeleland provinces.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12889-015-2182-7"

The effectiveness of these approaches is, however, suboptimal owing to limited implementation of screening programmes and restricted indications for HPV vaccination. Trials of HPV vaccination in women aged up to 55 years have shown almost 90% protection from cervical precancer caused by HPV16/18 among HPV16/18-DNA-negative women. We propose extending routine vaccination programmes to women of up to 30 years of age (and to the 45-50-year age groups in some settings), paired with at least one HPV-screening test at age 30 years or older. Expanding the indications for HPV vaccination and much greater use of HPV testing in screening programmes has the potential to accelerate the decline in cervical cancer incidence. Such a combined protocol would represent an attractive approach for many health-care systems, in particular, countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, and some more-developed parts of Africa. The role of vaccination in women aged &gt;30 years and the optimal number of HPV-screening tests required in vaccinated women remain important research issues. Cost-effectiveness models will help determine the optimal combination of HPV vaccination and screening in public health programmes, and to estimate the effects of such approaches in different populations.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=nrclinonc.2015.146"

We examined the effect of a government P4P scheme on utilisation, quality, and user costs of health services in Tanzania.METHODS: We evaluated the effects of a P4P scheme on utilisation of all maternal and child immunization services targeted by the scheme, and non-targeted general outpatient service use. We also evaluated effects on patient satisfaction with care and clinical content of antenatal care, and user costs. The evaluation was done in 150 facilities across all 7 intervention districts and 4 comparison districts with two rounds of data collection over 13-months in January 2012 and February 2013. We sampled 3000 households of women who had delivered in the 12 months prior to interview; 1500 patients attending health facilities for targeted and non-targeted services at each round of data collection. Difference-in-difference regression analysis was employed.FINDINGS: We estimated a significant positive effect on two out of eight targeted indicators. There was an 8.2% (95% CI: 3.6% to 12.8%) increase in coverage of institutional deliveries among women in the intervention area, and a 10.3% (95% CI: 4.4% to 16.1%) increase in the provision of anti-malarials during pregnancy. Use of non-targeted services reduced at dispensaries by 57.5 visits per month among children under five (95% CI: -110.2 to -4.9) and by 90.8 visits per month for those aged over five (95% CI: -156.5 to -25.2). There was no evidence of an effect of P4P on patient experience of care for targeted services. There was a 0.05 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) increase in the patient satisfaction score for non-targeted services. P4P was associated with a 5.0% reduction in those paying out of pocket for deliveries (95% CI: -9.3% to -0.7%) but there was no evidence of an effect on the average amount paid.CONCLUSION: This study adds to the very limited evidence on the effects of P4P at scale and highlights the potential risks of such schemes in relation to non-targeted service use. Further consideration of the design of P4P schemes is required to enhance progress towards universal health coverage, and close monitoring of effects on non-targeted services and user costs should be encouraged.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0135013"

The value of pharmaceuticals procured by primary health care facilities in 87 randomly selected districts for the Financial Year 2011/2012 was collected. Various specifications of the dependent variable (pharmaceutical expenditure) were used: total pharmaceutical expenditure, Per capita district pharmaceutical expenditure, pharmaceutical expenditure per district health facility and pharmaceutical expenditure per outpatient department visit. Andersen's behaviour model of health services utilisation was used as conceptual framework to identify independent variables likely to influence health care utilisation and hence pharmaceutical expenditure. Econometric analysis was conducted to estimate parameters of various regression models.RESULTS: All models were significant overall (P &lt; 0.01), with explanatory power ranging from 51 to 82%. The log linear model for total pharmaceutical expenditure explained about 80% of the observed variation in total pharmaceutical expenditure (Adjusted R(2) = 0.797) and contained the following variables: Immunisation coverage, Total outpatient department attendance, Urbanisation, Total number of government health facilities and total number of Health Centre IIs. The model based on Per capita Pharmaceutical expenditure explained about 50% of the observed variation in per capita pharmaceutical expenditure (Adjusted R(2) = 0.513) and was more balanced with the following variables: Outpatient per capita attendance, percentage of rural population below poverty line 2005, Male Literacy rate, Whether a district is characterised by MOH as difficult to reach or not and the Human poverty index.CONCLUSIONS: The log-linear model based on total pharmaceutical expenditure works acceptably well and can be considered useful for predicting future total pharmaceutical expenditure following observed trends. It can be used as a simple tool for rough estimation of the potential overall national primary health pharmaceutical expenditure to guide budget setting. The model based on pharmaceutical expenditure per capita is a more balanced model containing both need and enabling factor variables. These variables would be useful in allocating any set budget to districts.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12913-015-1002-1"

School-based delivery of HPV vaccines is cost-effective and successful uptake depends on school teachers' knowledge and acceptability of the vaccine. The aim of this study is to assess primary school teachers' knowledge and acceptability of HPV vaccine and to explore facilitators and barriers of an ongoing Gavi Alliance-supported vaccination program in Kitui County, Kenya.METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, mixed methods study in Central Division of Kitui County where the Ministry of Health is offering the quadrivalent HPV vaccine to grade four girls. Data on primary school teachers' awareness, knowledge and acceptability of HPV vaccine as well as facilitators and barriers to the project was collected through self-administered questionnaires and two focus group discussions.RESULTS: 339 teachers (60% female) completed the survey (62% response rate) and 13 participated in 2 focus group discussions. Vaccine awareness among teachers was high (90%), the level of knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer among teachers was moderate (48%, SD = 10.9) and females scored higher than males (50% vs. 46%, p = 0.002). Most teachers (89%) would recommend the vaccine to their daughter or close relatives. Those who would recommend the vaccine had more knowledge than those who would not (p = &lt;0.001). The main barriers were insufficient information about the vaccine, poor accessibility of schools, absenteeism of girls on vaccine days, and fear of side effects.CONCLUSIONS: Despite low to moderate levels of knowledge about HPV vaccine among school teachers, vaccine acceptability is high. Teachers with little knowledge on HPV vaccine are less likely to accept the vaccine than those who know more; this may affect uptake if not addressed. Empowering teachers to be vaccine champions in their community may be a feasible way of disseminating information about HPV vaccine and cervical cancer.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0135563"

In an effort to reduce health inequities, the government of Kenya in 2006 introduced the output-based approach (OBA), or voucher programme, to increase poor women's access to quality Safe Motherhood services including postnatal care. To help improve service quality, OBA programmes purchase services on behalf of the poor and marginalised, with provider reimbursements for verified services. Kenya's programme accredited health facilities in three districts as well as in two informal Nairobi settlements.METHODS: Postnatal care quality in voucher health facilities (n = 21) accredited in 2006 and in similar non-voucher health facilities (n = 20) are compared with cross sectional data collected in 2010. Summary scores for quality were calculated as additive sums of specific aspects of each attribute (structure, process, outcome). Measures of effect were assessed in a linear regression model accounting for clustering at facility level. Data were analysed using Stata 11.0.RESULTS: The overall quality of postnatal care is poor in voucher and non-voucher facilities, but many facilities demonstrated 'readiness' for postnatal care (structural attributes: infrastructure, equipment, supplies, staffing, training) indicated by high scores (83/111), with public voucher facilities scoring higher than public non-voucher facilities. The two groups of facilities evinced no significant differences in postnatal care mean process scores: 14.2/55 in voucher facilities versus 16.4/55 in non-voucher facilities; coefficient: -1.70 (-4.9, 1.5), p = 0.294. Significantly more newborns were seen within 48 hours (83.5% versus 72.1%: p = 0.001) and received Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (82.5% versus 76.5%: p &lt; 0.001) at voucher facilities than at non-voucher facilities.CONCLUSIONS: Four years after facility accreditation in Kenya, scores for postnatal care quality are low in all facilities, even those with Safe Motherhood vouchers. We recommend the Kenya OBA programme review its Safe Motherhood reimbursement package and draw lessons from supply side results-based financing initiatives, to improve postnatal care quality.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12884-015-0588-y"

Antiretrovirals taken by HIV-negative persons as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has the potential to avert infections in individuals in serodiscordant partnerships. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of implementing time-limited PrEP as a short-term bridge during the first six months of ART for the HIV-positive partner to prevent HIV transmission compared to increasing ART coverage is crucial to informing policy-makers considering PrEP implementation.METHODS: To estimate the real world delivery costs of PrEP, we conducted micro-costing and time and motion analyses in an open-label prospective study of PrEP and ART delivery targeted to high-risk serodiscordant couples in Uganda (the Partners Demonstration Project). The cost (in USD, in 2012) of PrEP and ART for serodiscordant couples was assessed, with and without research components, in the study setting. Using Ministry of Health costs, the cost of PrEP and ART provision within a government programme was estimated, as was the cost of providing PrEP in addition to ART. We parameterized an HIV transmission model to estimate the health and economic impacts of 1) PrEP and ART targeted to high-risk serodiscordant couples in the context of current ART use and 2) increasing ART coverage to 55% of HIV-positive persons with CD4 ≤500 cells/µL without PrEP. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per HIV infection and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted were calculated over 10 years.RESULTS: The annual cost of PrEP and ART delivery for serodiscordant couples was $1058 per couple in the study setting and $453 in the government setting. The portion of the programme cost due to PrEP was $408 and $92 per couple per year in the study and government settings, respectively. Over 10 years, a programme of PrEP and ART for high-risk serodiscordant couples was projected to avert 43% of HIV infections compared to current practice with an ICER of $1340 per infection averted. This was comparable to ART expansion alone, which would avert 37% of infections with an ICER of $1452.CONCLUSIONS: Using Uganda's gross domestic product per capita of $1681 as a threshold, PrEP and ART for high-risk persons have the potential for synergistic action and are cost-effective in preventing HIV infections in high prevalence settings. The annual cost of PrEP in this programme is less than $100 per serodiscordant couple if implemented in public clinics.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=20013"

Financial incentives have been effective at creating demand for social services in a variety of settings. Using methods of extended cost-effectiveness analysis, we compare the health and economic implications of three different vaccine delivery strategies for measles vaccination in Ethiopia: i) routine immunization, ii) routine immunization with financial incentives, and iii) mass campaigns, known as supplemental immunization activities (SIAs). We examine annual birth cohorts of almost 3,000,000 births over a ten year period, exploring variation in these outcomes based on economic status to understand how various options may improve equity. SIAs naturally achieve higher levels of vaccine coverage, but at higher costs. Routine immunization combined with financial incentives bolsters demand among more economically vulnerable households. The relative appeal of routine immunization with financial incentives and SIAs will depend on the policy environment, including short-term financial limitations, time horizons, and the types of outcomes that are desired. While the impact of financial incentives has been more thoroughly studied in other policy arenas, such as education, consideration of this approach alongside standard vaccination models such as SIAs is timely given the dialog around measles eradication.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26189009"

The current study evaluated use of a compact, prefilled, autodisable device (CPAD) to deliver pentavalent vaccine by field actors in Senegal and Vietnam.METHODS: We conducted a logistic, programmatic, and anthropological study that included a) interviews of immunization staff at different health system levels and parents attending immunization sessions; b) observation of immunization sessions including CPAD use on oranges; and c) document review.RESULTS: Respondents perceived that the CPAD would improve safety by being non-reusable and preventing needle and vaccine exposure during preparation. Preparation was considered simple and may reduce immunization time for staff and caretakers. CPAD impact on cold storage requirements depended on the current pentavalent vaccine being used; in both countries, CPAD would reduce the weight and volume of materials and safety boxes thereby potentially improving outreach strategies and waste disposal. CPAD also would reduce stock outages by bundling vaccine and syringes and reduce wastage by using a non-breakable plastic presentation. Respondents also cited potential challenges including ability to distinguish between CPAD and other pharmaceuticals delivered via a similar mechanism (such as contraceptives), safety, and concerns related to design and ease of administration (such as activation, ease of delivery, and needle diameter and length).CONCLUSIONS: Compared to current pentavalent vaccine presentations in Vietnam and Senegal, CPAD technology will address some of the main barriers to vaccination, such as supply chain issues and safety concerns among health workers and families. Most of the challenges we identified can be addressed with health worker training, minor design modifications, and health messaging targeting parents and communities. Potentially the largest remaining barrier is the marginal increase in pentavalent cost--if any--from CPAD use, which we did not assess in our study.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0132292"

In 2010 the population of South Africa was 50 million and the HIV prevalence was 11%. We used a previously developed methodology to determine severe influenza burden in South Africa. Hospitalized severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) incidence was calculated, stratified by HIV status, for four age groups using data from population-based surveillance in one site situated in Gauteng Province for 2009-2011. These rates were adjusted for each of the remaining 8 provinces based on their prevalence of risk factors for pneumonia and healthcare-seeking behavior. We estimated non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI from healthcare utilization surveys at two sites and used the percent of SARI cases positive for influenza from sentinel surveillance to derive the influenza-associated SARI rate. We applied rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI to census data to calculate the national number of cases. The percent of SARI cases that tested positive for influenza ranged from 7-17% depending on age group, year, province and HIV status. In 2010, there were an estimated 21,555 total severe influenza cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and 13,876 in HIV-infected individuals. In 2011, there were an estimated 29,892 total severe influenza cases in HIV-uninfected individuals and 17,289 in HIV-infected individuals.

An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on respondents' knowledge of the Ebola virus, the ways to prevent the disease, and their preventive practices, as well as their acceptability of and willingness-to-pay for a hypothetical vaccine against Ebola virus disease. The association between acceptability of the vaccine and other independent variables were evaluated using multivariate regression analysis.RESULTS: Ebola virus disease was considered to be a very serious disease by 38.5% of the 582 respondents (224/582), prior to receiving health education on Ebola virus and its vaccine. Eighty percent (80%) accepted to be vaccinated with Ebola vaccine. However, among those that accepted to be vaccinated, most would only accept after observing the outcome on others who have received the vaccine. More than 87.5% was willing to pay for the vaccine, although 55.2% was of the opinion that the vaccine should be provided free of charge.CONCLUSION: The level of acceptability of Ebola virus vaccine among respondents was impressive (though conditional), as well as their willingness to pay for it if the vaccine is not publicly funded. In order to achieve a high uptake of the vaccine, information and education on the vaccine should be extensively shared with the public prior to the introduction of the vaccine, and the vaccine should be provided free of charge by government.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003838"

However, complete immunization coverage remains low particularly in rural areas of Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the level of immunization coverage and associated factors in Lay Armachiho District, North Gondar zone, Northwest Ethiopia. A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in March, 2014 among 751 pairs of mothers to children aged 12-23 months in Lay Armachiho District. A two stage sampling technique was employed. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to compute association between factors and immunization status of children. Backwards stepwise regression method was used and those variables significant at p value 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of the children were fully immunized during the study period. Dropout rate was 6.5% for BCG to measles, 2.7% for Penta1 to Penta3 and 4.5% for Pnemonia1 to Pnemonia3. The likelihood of children to be fully immunized among mothers who identified the number of sessions needed for vaccination were higher than those who did not [AOR = 2.8 (95% C1 = 1.89, 4.2)]. Full immunization status of children was higher among mothers who know the age at which the child become fully immunized than who did not know [AOR = 2.93 (95% CI = 2.02, 4.3)]. Taking tetanus toxoid immunization during pregnancy showed statistically significant association with full immunization of children [AOR 1.6 (95% CI = 1.06, 2.62)]. Urban children were more likely to be fully immunized than rural [AOR = 1.82 (95% CI = 1.15, 2.80)] and being male were more likely to be fully immunized than female [AOR = 1.80 (95% CI = 1.26, 2.6)].CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: Vaccination coverage was low compared to the Millennium Development Goals target. It is important to increase and maintain the immunization level to the intended target. Efforts should be made to promote women's' awareness on tetanus toxoid immunization, when the child should start vaccination, number of sessions needed to complete immunization, and when a child become complete vaccination to improve immunization coverage through health development army and health professionals working at antenatal care, postnatal care and immunization units.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s13104-015-1192-y"

Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the leading causes of bacterial pneumonia. Vaccines for both of these pathogens are available to prevent pneumonia. Problem This study describes an economic analysis from a publicly funded health care system perspective performed on a birth cohort in Somalia, a country that has experienced a protracted humanitarian emergency.METHODS: An impact and cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing: no vaccine, Hib vaccine only, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 10 (PCV10) only, and both together administered through supplemental immunization activities (SIAs). The main summary measure was the incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. One-way sensitivity analysis was conducted for uncertainty in parameter values.RESULTS: Each SIA would avert a substantial number of cases and deaths. Compared with no vaccine, the DALYs averted by two SIAs for two doses of Hib vaccine was US $202.93 (lower and upper limits: $121.80-$623.52), two doses of PCV10 was US $161.51 ($107.24-$227.21), and two doses of both vaccines was US $152.42 ($101.20-$214.42). Variables that influenced the cost-effectiveness for each strategy most substantially were vaccine effectiveness, case fatality rates (CFRs), and disease burden.CONCLUSIONS: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a cost-effective intervention as costing one to three times the per capita gross domestic product (GDP; in 2011, for Somalia=US $112). Based on the presented model, Hib vaccine alone, PCV10 alone, or Hib vaccine and PCV10 given together in SIAs are cost-effective interventions in Somalia. The WHO/Strategic Advisory Group of Experts decision-making factors for vaccine deployment appear to have all been met: the disease burden is large, the vaccine-related risk is low, prevention in this setting is more feasible than treatment, the vaccine duration probably is sufficient for the vulnerable period of the child's life, cost is reasonable, and herd immunity is possible.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26061190"

With liver disease, these disparities are exacerbated by a combination of limited awareness and preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in addition to the diagnostic and management costs. Sub-Saharan Africa, comprising 11% of the world's population, disproportionately has 24% of the global disease burden, yet allocates &lt;1% of global spend on health. It has 3% of the global healthcare workforce with a mean of 0.8 healthcare workers per 1000 population. Barriers to healthcare access are many and compounded by limited civil registration data, socio-economic inequalities, discrepancies in private and public healthcare services and geopolitical strife. The UN 2014 report on the Millennium Development Goals suggest that sub-Saharan Africa will probably not meet several goals, however with HIV/AIDS and Malaria (goal 6), many successes have been achieved. A 2010 Global Burden of Disease study demonstrated that cirrhosis mortality in sub-Saharan Africa doubled between 1980 and 2010. Aetiologies included hepatitis B (34%), hepatitis C (17%), alcohol (18%) and unknown in 31%. Hepatitis B, C and alcohol accounted for 47, 23 and 20% of hepatocellular carcinoma respectively. In 10%, the underlying aetiology was not known. Liver disease reflects the broader disparities in healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa. However, many of these challenges are not insurmountable as vaccines and new therapies could comprehensively deal with the burden of viral hepatitis. Access to and affordability of therapeutics remains the major barrier.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=26053588"

In this study, we evaluated the use of BBL™ Sensi-Discs™ and FTA(®) cards for storage and transportation of samples for virus isolation, EIA, and RT-PCR testing. Infectious rotavirus was recovered after 30 days of storage on Sensi-Discs™ at room temperature.

The present study compares single-antigen Wb123- and Ov16-based POC tests with an integrated configuration to detect antibodies to Wb123 and Ov16 simultaneously. Wb123 and Ov16 isolates were striped onto lateral flow strips containing anti-IgG4. Sera from W. bancrofti-, O. volvulus-, and other helminth-infected or -uninfected individuals were added to the strips with buffer. Strips were read for the appearance of a positive or negative test line for both antigens at 20 min and following drying. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated for the single-antigen and biplex strips. Single and biplex lateral flow strips showed nearly identical results, with &gt;90% sensitivity for Ov16 and &gt;92% sensitivity for Wb123. Overall specificities for the single and biplex tests were 98% and 96% for Ov16 and Wb123, respectively.

Since the first report of EVD in March 2014, the number of cases has increased rapidly, with the fatality rate of &gt;50%. The most prevalent Ebola virus belongs to the species of Zaire ebolavirus, with a fatality rate as high as 90%. Although there were cases introduced into other continents, Africa is the endemic area where fruit bats and apes are suspected to be Ebola virus carriers. The virus might be transmitted from the host animals to humans if humans consume raw or not fully cooked and contaminated meats. However, human-to-human transmission via close contact is the major route of current outbreaks. EVD can occur during any season and affect people of any race and age group. Direct contact with body fluids of EVD patients or living in contaminated environments greatly increases the risk of being infected. Transmission via aerosol less likely, but transmission via virus-containing droplets is possible in humans. Thus, health care providers are facing danger of getting Ebola virus infection. To date, vaccines, drugs and/or therapies to prevent Ebola virus infection or treat EVD are limited. Medical workers should follow the current standard prophylactic procedures. The military can orchestrate efficient care to mass EVD patients. Although it is necessary to speed up the pace of developing effective vaccine and therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of EVD, public health prevention and management should be important issue at present to control the spread of this disease cost-effectively.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s40779-015-0035-4"

However, childhood vitamin A supplementation has not reached adequate levels of coverage in developing countries. This study aimed to identify factors associated with childhood vitamin A supplementation in Ethiopia.STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with stratified, two-stage cluster design.METHODS: Analysis of data from the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) was used to identify factors associated with childhood vitamin A supplementation. Data for 9276 children aged 6-59 months were included in the analysis. Binary and multivariable logistic regression models were used.RESULTS: Over half [54.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 53.48-55.51%] of children aged 6-59 months had received vitamin A supplementation in the last six months. Regional differences were found, ranging from 28.1% in Somali to 83.2% in Tigray (P &lt; 0.001). Children in the poorest wealth index category [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.60, 95% CI 0.47-0.77], children with mothers who did not attend any antenatal care (ANC) appointments (AOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.48-0.67), infants aged 6-11 months (AOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.42-0.65), children with mothers who did not have a postnatal medical check-up (AOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56-0.86) and children with mothers who had not worked in the last year (AOR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76-0.97) were less likely to have received vitamin A supplementation in the last six months.CONCLUSION: Coverage of childhood vitamin A supplementation was not optimum in Ethiopia and regional differences were found. Lack of a maternal postnatal medical check-up, lack of ANC attendance, poorest wealth index, mother who had not worked in the last year and infant in youngest age group were associated with lower odds of receiving vitamin A supplementation over the last six months. Provision and promotion of ANC and postnatal care, and strengthening routine immunization activity, especially among infants in the youngest age group, are recommended to increase coverage of childhood vitamin A supplementation.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25982948"

In many cases, industry has the technologies, but lacks the impetus to direct resources to develop these vaccine products. The present emergency with the Ebola vaccine provides us an excellent example where a vaccine was feasible several years ago, but the global health community waited for a humanitarian disaster to direct efforts and resources to develop this vaccine. In the beginning of 2015, the first large-scale trials of two experimental vaccines against Ebola virus disease have begun in West Africa. During the past few years, several institutions have dedicated efforts to the development of vaccines against diseases present only in low-income countries. These include the International Vaccine Institute, the Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health, the Hilleman Institute, the Sabin Vaccine Institute and the Infectious Disease Research Institute. Nevertheless, solving this problem requires a more significant global effort than that currently invested. These efforts include a clear policy, global coordination of funds dedicated to the development of neglected disease and an agreement on regulatory strategies and incentives for the private sector.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=rstb.2014.0150"

Dog mass vaccination is the recommended method for rabies control and elimination. We report on the first small-scale mass dog vaccination campaign trial in Bamako, Mali. Our objective was to estimate coverage of the vaccination campaign and to quantify determinants of intervention effectiveness. In September 2013, a central point vaccination campaign--free of cost for dog owners--was carried out in 17 posts on three consecutive days within Bamako's Commune 1. Vaccination coverage and the proportion of ownerless dogs were estimated by combining mark-recapture household and transect surveys using Bayesian modeling. The estimated vaccination coverage was 17.6% (95% Credibility Interval, CI: 14.4-22.1%) which is far below the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended vaccination coverage of 70%. The Bayesian estimate for the owned dog population of Commune 1 was 3459 dogs (95% CI: 2786-4131) and the proportion of ownerless dogs was about 8%. The low coverage observed is primarily attributed to low participation by dog owners. Dog owners reported several reasons for not bringing their dogs to the vaccination posts. The most frequently reported reasons for non-attendance were lack of information (25%) and the inability to handle the dog (16%). For 37% of respondents, no clear reason was given for non-vaccination. Despite low coverage, the vaccination campaign in Bamako was relatively easy to implement, both in terms of logistics and organization. Almost half of the participating dog owners brought their pets on the first day of the campaign. Participatory stakeholder processes involving communities and local authorities are needed to identify effective communication channels and locally adapted vaccination strategies, which could include both central-point and door-to-door vaccination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25953653"

The consequences of these choices will influence health outcomes as well as the financial risk protection provided to different segments of the population. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the size and distribution of benefits due to treatment and prevention of diarrhoea (ie, rotavirus vaccination).METHODS: We use an economic model to examine the impacts of universal public finance (UPF) of diarrhoeal treatment alone, as opposed to diarrhoeal treatment along with rotavirus vaccination in Ethiopia using extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA). ECEA allows us to measure the health gains and financial risk protection provided by these interventions for each wealth quintile. Our model compares a baseline situation with diarrhoeal treatment seeking of 32% (overall) and no rotavirus vaccination, to a situation where UPF increases treatment seeking by 20 percentage points for each quintile and rotavirus vaccination reaches DTP (diphteria, pertussis, tetanus) 2 levels for each quintile (overall rate of 52%). We calculate deaths averted, private expenditures averted and costs incurred by the government under the baseline situation and with UPF.RESULTS: We find that diarrhoeal treatment paired with rotavirus vaccination is more cost effective than diarrhoeal treatment alone for the metrics we examine in this paper (deaths and private expenditures averted). Per US$1 million invested, diarrhoeal treatment saves 44 lives and averts US$115,000 in private expenditures. For the same investment, diarrhoeal treatment and rotavirus vaccination save 61 lives and avert US$150,000 in private expenditures. The health benefits of these interventions tend to benefit the poor, while the financial benefits favour the better-off.CONCLUSIONS: Policymakers should consider multiple benefit streams as well as their scale and incidence when considering public finance of health interventions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=bmjopen-2014-006402"

Tetanus toxoid vaccination of pregnant women is the most widely implemented maternal vaccine in developing countries where neonatal mortality is the highest. We identified barriers to maternal tetanus vaccination in developing African and Asian countries to identify means of improving maternal immunization platforms in these countries.METHOD: We categorized barriers into health system, health care provider and patient barriers to maternal tetanus immunization and conducted a literature review on each category. Due to limited literature from Africa, we conducted a pilot survey of health care providers in Malawi on barriers they experience in immunizing pregnant women.RESULTS: The major barriers of the health system are due to inadequate financial and human resources which translate to inadequate vaccination services delivery and logistics management. Health care providers are limited by poor attendance of Antenatal Care and inadequate knowledge on vaccinating pregnant women. Patient barriers are due to lack of education and knowledge on pregnancy immunization and socioeconomic factors such as low income and high parity.CONCLUSION: There are several factors that affect maternal tetanus immunization. Increasing knowledge in health care providers and patients, increasing antenatal care attendance and outreach activities will aid the uptake of maternal immunization. Health system barriers are more difficult to address requiring an improvement of overall immunization services. Further analyses of maternal immunization specific barriers and the means of addressing them are required to strengthen the existing program and provide a more efficient delivery system for additional maternal vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25936666"

A growing body of evidence indicates that surgery can also be highly cost effective in low-income settings, but our current knowledge of the actual cost of surgery in such settings is limited. This study was carried out to obtain data on the costs of commonly performed operative procedures in a rural/semiurban setting in eastern Uganda.METHODS: A prospective, facility-based study carried out at a general district hospital (public) and a mission hospital (private, not-for-profit) in the Iganga and Mayuge districts in eastern Uganda. Items included in the cost calculations were staff time, materials and medicines, overhead costs, and capital costs.RESULTS: The cost of surgery was higher at the mission hospital, with higher expenditure and lower productivity than the public hospital. The most commonly performed major procedures were caesarean section, uterine evacuation, and herniorrhaphy for groin hernia. The costs for these interventions varied between $68.4 and $74.4, $25.0 and $32.6, and $58.6 and $66.0, respectively. The most commonly performed minor procedures were circumcision, suture of cuts and lacerations, and incision and drainage of abscess.

CHMI studies provide a cost-effective and expeditious way to circumvent the use of large-scale field efficacy studies to deselect intervention candidates. However, to date few modern CHMI studies have been performed in malaria-endemic countries.METHODS: An open-label, randomized pilot CHMI study was conducted using aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, infectious P. falciparum sporozoites (SPZ) (Sanaria® PfSPZ Challenge) administered intramuscularly (IM) to healthy Kenyan adults (n = 28) with varying degrees of prior exposure to P. falciparum. The purpose of the study was to establish the PfSPZ Challenge CHMI model in a Kenyan setting with the aim of increasing the international capacity for efficacy testing of malaria vaccines and drugs, and allowing earlier assessment of efficacy in a population for which interventions are being developed. This was part of the EDCTP-funded capacity development of the CHMI platform in Africa.DISCUSSION: This paper discusses in detail lessons learnt from conducting the first CHMI study in Kenya. Issues pertinent to the African setting, including community sensitization, consent and recruitment are considered. Detailed reasoning regarding the study design (for example, dose and route of administration of PfSPZ Challenge, criteria for grouping volunteers according to prior exposure to malaria and duration of follow-up post CHMI) are given and changes other centres may want to consider for future studies are suggested.CONCLUSIONS: Performing CHMI studies in an African setting presents unique but surmountable challenges and offers great opportunity for acceleration of malaria vaccine and drug development. The reflections in this paper aim to aid other centres and partners intending to use the CHMI model in Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12936-015-0671-x"

Data from the community is insufficient and most case fatality estimates are extrapolations from hospital based studies that do not cover all geographical regions, and include cases which may or not be culture confirmed, MDR resistant or sensitive cases, or from mixed populations of age (adults and children). Complications of typhoid such as intestinal perforation, bone marrow suppression, and encephalopathy are dependent on MDR/Fluoroquinolone resistant Salmonella infection, comorbidities such as malnutrition, and health-care access. Data is again insufficient to estimate the true burden of Typhoid Fever in different regions and groups of populations. Although there has been a rapid decline in cases in developed countries with the advent of improved sanitization, timely and easy access to health care and laboratories, this is still not the case in the developing countries where Typhoid deaths are still occurring. The way forward is to develop rapid and cost effective point of care diagnostic tests, put in place validated clinical algorithms for suspected clinical cases, and design prospective, and community based studies in different groups, implement maintenance of electronic health records in large public sector hospitals and regions to identify populations that will benefit most from the implementation of vaccine. Policies on public health education and typhoid vaccine may help to reduce morbidity and mortality due to the disease.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25921727"

This paper updates estimates of immunization costs and financing based on information from comprehensive multi-year plans (cMYPs) from GAVI-eligible countries during a period when countries planned to introduce a range of new vaccines (2008-2016).METHODS: The analysis database included information from baseline and 5-year projection years for each country cMYP, resulting in a total sample size of 243 observations. Two-thirds were from African countries. Cost data included personnel, vaccine, injection, transport, training, maintenance, cold chain and other capital investments. Financing from government and external sources was evaluated. All estimates were converted to 2010 US Dollars. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA, and results were population-weighted.RESULTS: Results pertain to country planning estimates. Average annual routine immunization cost was $62 million. Vaccines continued to be the major cost driver (51%) followed by immunization-specific personnel costs (22%). Non-vaccine delivery costs accounted for almost half of routine program costs (44%). Routine delivery cost per dose averaged $0.61 and the delivery cost per infant was $10. The cost per DTP3 vaccinated child was $27. Routine program costs increased with each new vaccine introduced. Costs accounted for 5% of government health expenditures. Governments accounted for 67% of financing.CONCLUSION: Total and average costs of routine immunization programs are rising as coverage rates increase and new vaccines are introduced. The cost of delivering vaccines is nearly equivalent to the cost of vaccines. Governments are financing greater proportions of the immunization program but there may be limits in resource scarce countries. Price reductions for new vaccines will help reduce costs and the burden of financing. Strategies to improve efficiency in service delivery should be pursued.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(15)00022-5"

A good understanding of current and future funding needs, commitments, and gaps is required to enhance planning, improve resource allocation and mobilisation, and to avoid funding bottlenecks, as well as to ensure that co-funding arrangements are appropriate. This study aimed to map the resource envelope and flows for immunisation in Uganda in 2009/10 and 2010/11.METHODS: To assess costs and financing of immunisation, the study applied a common methodology as part of the multi-country Expanded Program on Immunisation Costing (EPIC) study (Brenzel et al., 2015). The financial mapping developed a customised extension of the System of Health Accounts (SHA) codes to explore immunisation financing in detail. Data were collected from government and external sources. The mapping was able to assess financing more comprehensively than many studies, and the simultaneous costing of routine immunisation collected detailed data about human resources costs.RESULTS: The Ugandan government contributed 56% and 42% of routine immunisation funds in 2009/10 and 2010/11, respectively, higher than previously estimated, and managed up to 90% of funds. Direct delivery of services used 93% of the immunisation financial resources in 2010/11, while the above service delivery costs were small (7%). Vaccines and supplies (41%) and salaries (38%) absorbed most funding. There were differences in the key cost categories between actual resource flows and the estimates from the comprehensive multi-year plan (cMYP).CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight that governments and partners need to improve systems to routinely track immunisation financing flows for enhanced accountability, performance, and sustainability. The modified SHA coding allowed financing to be mapped to specific immunisation activities, and could be used for standardised, resource tracking compatible with National Health Accounts (NHA). Recommendations are made for refining routine resource mapping approaches.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(14)01708-3"

This study seeks to address this issue through an analysis of determinants of health facility immunization costs.METHODS: A statistical analysis on facility routine delivery and vaccine costs was conducted using ordinary least squares regression. Explanatory variables included the number of doses administered; proportion of time spent by facility staff on immunization; average staff wage; whether the health facility had enough staff; presence of cold chain equipment; distance to a vaccine collection point; and, facility ownership. Data were drawn from representative samples of primary care facilities in Benin and Ghana (46 and 50 facilities, respectively) collected as part of the EPIC studies.RESULTS: Weighted average RI immunization facility cost was US$ 16,459 in Ghana and US$ 14,994 in Benin. The regression found total doses administered to be positively and significantly associated with facility cost in both countries. A 10% increase in doses resulted in a 4% increase in cost in Ghana, and a 7.5% increase in Benin. In Ghana, the proportion of immunization time, presence of cold chain, and sufficiency of staff were positively and significantly associated with total cost. In Benin, facility cost was negatively and significantly related to distance to the vaccine collection point. In the pooled sample, facilities in capital cities were associated with significantly higher costs.CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence on the importance of the level of scale in determining facility immunization cost, as well as the role of availability of health workers and time they spend on immunization in Ghana and Benin. This type of analysis can provide insights into the costs of scaling up immunization services, and can assist with development of more efficient immunization strategies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(14)01724-1"

Data on inputs, prices and outputs were collected in a stratified, random sample of 51 facilities in nine districts between December 2012 and March 2013 using a pre-tested questionnaire. Shared inputs were allocated to RI costs on the basis of tracing factors developed for the study. A comprehensive set of costs were analysed to obtain total and unit costs, at facility and above-facility levels.RESULTS: The total annual economic cost of RI was $38.16 million, equivalent to approximately 10% of government health spending. Government contributed 83% of finances. Labour accounted for the lion's share (49%) of total costs followed by vaccines (16%) and travel allowances (12%). Analysis of specific activity costs showed that outreach and facility-based services accounted for half of total economic costs. Costs for managing the program at district, provincial and national levels (above-facility costs) represented 24% of total costs. Average unit costs were $7.18 per dose, $59.32 per infant and $65.89 per DPT3 immunised child, with markedly higher unit costs in rural facilities. Analyses suggest that greater efficiency is associated with higher utilisation levels and urban facility type.CONCLUSIONS: Total and unit costs, and government's contribution, were considerably higher than previous Zambian estimates and international benchmarks. These findings have substantial implications for planners, efficiency improvement and sustainable financing, particularly as new vaccines are introduced. Variations in immunisation costs at facility level warrant further statistical analyses.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(14)01693-4"

Ghana was the first African country to simultaneously introduce rotavirus, pneumococcal and measles second-dose vaccines. Given their high price, it would be beneficial to Ghanaian health authorities to know the true cost of their introduction.METHODS: The economic costs of routine immunization for 2011 and the incremental costs of new vaccines were assessed as part of a multi-country study on costing and financing of routine immunization known as the Expanded Program on Immunization Costing (EPIC). Immunization delivery costs were evaluated at the local facility, district, regional, and central levels. Stratified random sampling was used for district and facility selection. We calculated the allocation of nationwide costs to the four health-system levels.RESULTS: The total aggregated national costs for routine immunization - including vaccine costs - equaled US$ 53.5 million during 2011 (including central, regional, and district costs); this equated to US$ 60.3 per fully immunized child (FIC) when counting vaccine costs, or US$ 48.1 without. National immunization program delivery costs were allocated as follows: local facility level, 85% of total national cost; district, 11%; central, 2% and regional, 2%. Salaried labor represented 61% of total costs, and vaccines represented 17%. For new vaccine introduction, programmatic start-up costs amounted to US$ 3.9 million, primarily due to salaried labor (66%). The mean facility-level cost per vaccine dose administered in a routine immunization program was US$ 5.1 (with a range of US$ 2.4-7.8 depending on facility characteristics) and US$ 3.7 for delivery costs.DISCUSSION: We identified a high cost per fully immunized child, mostly due to non-vaccine costs at the facility level, which indicates that immunization program financing - whether national or donor-driven - must take a broad viewpoint. This substantial variation in overall costs emphasizes the additional effort associated with reaching children in various settings.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(15)00030-4"

We performed an economic analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this vaccine in Egypt and to provide the decision-makers with needed evidence.METHODS: The analysis was done using the TRIVAC model. Data included demographic characteristics, burden of disease, coverage and efficacy of the vaccine, health resource utilization, and costs of pneumococcal disease vaccination and treatment. Whenever possible, we used national or regional data. Two alternatives were compared: (1) general vaccination of children younger than 5 years with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), using a three-dose schedule without booster, and (2) no vaccination. Outcomes of 10 cohorts from birth to 5 years were analyzed. The study was performed from the governmental perspective and selected public health providers.RESULTS: In comparison to no vaccine, the introduction of PCV13 would be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 3916 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted (government perspective). The total incremental cost of the PCV vaccination program (10 cohorts) would be approximately US$ 1.09 billion. Over the 10 cohorts, the program would avert 8583 pneumococcal deaths - 42% of all pneumococcal-related deaths.CONCLUSION: The introduction of PCV13 would be a good value for money from the government perspective. It would represent a high-impact public health intervention for Egypt and respond to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) resolution on reducing pneumonia burden and overall child mortality. Strengthening surveillance will be critical to generating high-quality national data, improving future economic analyses that support evidence-based decisions for introducing vaccines and public health interventions, and to monitoring their impact.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(14)01697-1"

Among African children hospitalized with diarrhea, 38% of the cases are due to rotavirus. In Senegal, rotavirus deaths are estimated to represent 5.4% of all deaths among children under 5. Along with the substantial disease burden, there is a growing awareness of the economic burden created by diarrheal disease. This analysis aims to provide policymakers with more consistent and reliable economic evidence to support the decision-making process about the introduction and maintenance of a rotavirus vaccine program.METHODS: The study was conducted using the processes and tools first established by the Pan American Health Organization's ProVac Initiative in the Latin American region. TRIVAC version 2.0, an Excel-based model, was used to perform the analysis. The costs and health outcomes were calculated for 20 successive birth cohorts (2014-2033). Model inputs were gathered from local, national, and international sources with the guidance of a Senegalese group of experts including local pediatricians, personnel from the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, as well as disease-surveillance and laboratory specialists.RESULTS: The cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, discounted at 3%, is US$ 92 from the health care provider perspective and US$ 73 from the societal perspective. For the 20 cohorts, the vaccine is projected to prevent more than 2 million cases of rotavirus and to avert more than 8500 deaths. The proportion of rotavirus deaths averted is estimated to be 42%. For 20 cohorts, the discounted net costs of the program were estimated to be US$ 17.6 million from the healthcare provider perspective and US$ 13.8 million from the societal perspective.CONCLUSION: From both perspectives, introducing the rotavirus vaccine is highly cost-effective compared to no vaccination. The results are consistent with those found in many African countries. The ProVac process and tools contributed to a collaborative, country-led process in Senegal that provides a platform for gathering and reporting evidence for vaccine decision-making.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(14)01720-4"

This paper presents the results of prospective cost-effectiveness analyses for rotavirus vaccine introduction for Kenya and Uganda.METHODOLOGY: In each country, a national consultant worked with a national technical working group to identify appropriate data and validate study results. Secondary data on demographics, disease burden, health utilization, and costs were used to populate the TRIVAC cost-effectiveness model. The baseline analysis assumed an initial vaccine price of $0.20 per dose, corresponding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance stipulated copay for low-income countries. The incremental cost-effectiveness of a 2-dose rotavirus vaccination schedule was evaluated for 20 successive birth cohorts from the government perspective in both countries, and from the societal perspective in Uganda.RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2033, rotavirus vaccination can avert approximately 60,935 and 216,454 undiscounted deaths and hospital admissions respectively in children under 5 years in Kenya. In Uganda, the respective number of undiscounted deaths and hospital admission averted is 70,236 and 329,779 between 2016 and 2035. Over the 20-year period, the discounted vaccine program costs are around US$ 80 million in Kenya and US$ 60 million in Uganda. Discounted government health service costs avoided are US$ 30 million in Kenya and US$ 10 million in Uganda (or US$ 18 million including household costs). The cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted from a government perspective is US$ 38 in Kenya and US$ 34 in Uganda (US$ 29 from a societal perspective).CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus vaccine introduction is highly cost-effective in both countries in a range of plausible 'what-if' scenarios. The involvement of national experts improves the quality of data used, is likely to increase acceptability of the results in decision-making, and can contribute to strengthened national capacity to undertake economic evaluations.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(15)00027-4"

Malawi introduced pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines to the immunisation programme in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Evaluating their effectiveness is vital to ensure optimal implementation and justify sustained investment.DESIGN: A national evaluation platform was established to determine vaccine effectiveness and impact in Malawi. Impact and effectiveness against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease, radiological pneumonia and rotavirus gastroenteritis are investigated using before-after incidence comparisons and case-control designs, respectively. Mortality is assessed using a prospective population cohort. Cost-effectiveness evaluation is nested within the case-control studies. We describe platform characteristics including strengths and weaknesses for conducting vaccine evaluations.DISCUSSION: Integrating data from individual level and ecological methods across multiple sites provides comprehensive information for policymakers on programme impact and vaccine effectiveness including changes in serotype/genotype distribution over time. Challenges to robust vaccine evaluation in real-world conditions include: vaccination ascertainment; pre-existing rapid decline in mortality and pneumococcal disease in the context of non-vaccine interventions; and the maintenance of completeness and quality of reporting at scale and over time. In observational non-randomised designs ascertainment of vaccine status may be biased particularly in infants with fatal outcomes. In the context of multiple population level interventions targeting study endpoints attribution of reduced incidence to vaccine impact may be flawed. Providing evidence from several independent but complementary studies will provide the greatest confidence in assigning impact. Welcome declines in disease incidence and in child mortality make accrual of required sample sizes difficult, necessitating large studies to detect the relatively small but potentially significant contribution of vaccines to mortality prevention. Careful evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and impact in such settings is critical to sustaining support for vaccine programmes. Our evaluation platform covers a large population with a high prevalence of HIV and malnutrition and its findings will be relevant to other settings in sub-Saharan Africa.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25917672"

Financial constraints and conflicting development agendas, especially tension between ranching and pastoralism, deterred early colonial applications of veterinary science that might have led to an early diagnosis. European veterinarians, guarding their authority against medical researchers, opposed inoculation therapies in the case of Rinderpest in favor of veterinary policing despite recent breakthroughs in vaccine research.

This neglect is, in part, a consequence of under-reporting, resulting in an underestimation of their global burden that downgrades their relevance to policy-makers and funding agencies. Increasing awareness about the causes of NZDs and how they can be prevented could reduce the incidence of many endemic zoonoses. Addressing NZDs by targeting the animal reservoir can deliver a double benefit, as enhanced animal health means a reduced risk of infection for humans, as well as improved livelihoods through increased animal productivity. Advocacy for NZD control is increasing, but with it comes a growing awareness that NZD control demands activities both in the short term and over a long period of time. Moreover, despite the promise of cheap, effective vaccines or other control tools, these endemic diseases will not be sustainably controlled in the near future without long-term financial commitment, particularly as disease incidence decreases and other health priorities take hold. NZD intervention costs can seem high when compared with the public health benefits alone, but these costs are easily outweighed when a full cross-sector analysis is carried out and monetary/non-monetary benefits--particularly regarding the livestock sector--are taken into account. Public-private partnerships have recently provided advocacy for human disease control, and could prove equally effective in addressing endemic zoonoses through harnessing social impact investments. Evidence of the disease burdens imposed on communities by the NZDs and demonstration of the cost-effectiveness of integrated control can strengthen the case for a One Health approach to endemic zoonotic disease control.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25911990"

We investigated Du151, a dual-infected individual with rapid disease progression. At her death 19 months postinfection (mpi), she was infected with a recombinant variant, which outgrew both parental viruses. We aimed to determine whether the recombinant virus had enhanced Env entry efficiency compared to the parental viruses and to identify the functional determinant. We generated 15 env clones at 1, 2, 8, and 19 mpi. Pseudovirus carrying a recombinant Env clone (PSV clone), C18 (19 mpi), had significantly higher entry efficiency compared to the parents, suggesting that the recombinant virus had enhanced fitness. To identify the functional determinant, we compared two recombinant PSV clones (C18 and C63)-differing in entry efficiency (2-fold) and by four and three amino acids in gp120 and gp41, respectively. The increased entry efficiency of a C18-gp41 PSV chimera indicated that the three amino acids in the C18 gp41 region were involved (K658, G671, and F717). Site-directed mutagenesis of the three amino acids of C63 showed that a single amino acid mutation, R658K, increased pseudovirion entry efficiency. The introduction of R658 into two PSV clones (C1 and C18) decreased their entry efficiency, suggesting that R658 carries a fitness cost.

The ESHE Project was designed to contribute to reducing high child mortality rates at scale among 14.5 million people through the 'three pillars' approach. This approach aimed to (i) strengthen health systems, (ii) improve health workers' performance, and (iii) engage the community. The intervention was designed with national and subnational stakeholders' input. To measure the Project's effect on the coverage of child health practices, we used a quasi-experimental design, with representative household survey data from the three most populous regions of Ethiopia, collected at the 2003-2004 baseline and 2008 endline surveys of the Project. Adifference-in-differences analysis model detected an absolute effect of the ESHE intervention of 8.4% points for DTP3 coverage (p=0.007), 12.9% points for measles vaccination coverage (p&lt;0.001), 12.6% points for latrines (p=0.002), and 9.8% points for vitamin A supplementation (p&lt;0.001) across the ESHE-intervention districts (woredas) compared to all non-ESHE districts of the same three regions. Improvements in the use of modern family planning methods and exclusive breastfeeding were not significant. Important regional variations are discussed. ESHE was one of several partners of the Ministry of Health whose combined efforts led to accelerated progress in the coverage of child health practices.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25895187"

In addition to health gains, some policies such as public finance can insure against catastrophic health expenditures. We aimed to evaluate the health and financial risk protection benefits of selected interventions that could be publicly financed by the government of Ethiopia.METHODS: We used extended cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the health gains (deaths averted) and financial risk protection afforded (cases of poverty averted) by a bundle of nine (among many other) interventions that the Government of Ethiopia aims to make universally available. These nine interventions were measles vaccination, rotavirus vaccination, pneumococcal conjugate vaccination, diarrhoea treatment, malaria treatment, pneumonia treatment, caesarean section surgery, hypertension treatment, and tuberculosis treatment.FINDINGS: Our analysis shows that, per dollar spent by the Ethiopian Government, the interventions that avert the most deaths are measles vaccination (367 deaths averted per $100,000 spent), pneumococcal conjugate vaccination (170 deaths averted per $100,000 spent), and caesarean section surgery (141 deaths averted per $100,000 spent). The interventions that avert the most cases of poverty are caesarean section surgery (98 cases averted per $100,000 spent), tuberculosis treatment (96 cases averted per $100,000 spent), and hypertension treatment (84 cases averted per $100,000 spent).INTERPRETATION: Our approach incorporates financial risk protection into the economic evaluation of health interventions and therefore provides information about the efficiency of attainment of both major objectives of a health system: improved health and financial risk protection. One intervention might rank higher on one or both metrics than another, which shows how intervention choice-the selection of a pathway to universal health coverage-might involve weighing up of sometimes competing objectives. This understanding can help policy makers to select interventions to target specific policy goals (ie, improved health or financial risk protection). It is especially relevant for the design and sequencing of universal health coverage to meet the needs of poor populations.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S2214-109X(14)70346-8"

Primary containers with a greater number of doses per vial each improved vaccine availability by 19% and reduced logistics costs by $0.05 per dose administered, while reducing the total costs by up to $0.25 per dose administered. Changes in supply chain performance were more extreme in departments with greater constraints. Implementing a vial opening threshold reversed the direction of many of these effects.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that one size may not fit all when choosing a primary vaccine container. Rather, the choice depends on characteristics of the vaccine, the vaccine supply chain, immunization session size, and goals of decision makers. In fact, the optimal vial size may vary among locations within a country. Simulation modeling can help identify tailored approaches to improve availability and efficiency.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25889160"

Timely and accurate measurements of levels and trends in key health indicators at local levels are crucial to assess progress and identify drivers of success and areas that may be lagging behind.METHODS: We generated estimates of 17 key maternal and child health indicators for Zambia's 72 districts from 1990 to 2010 using surveys, censuses, and administrative data. We used a three-step statistical model involving spatial-temporal smoothing and Gaussian process regression. We generated estimates at the national level for each indicator by calculating the population-weighted mean of the district values and calculated composite coverage as the average of 10 priority interventions.RESULTS: National estimates masked substantial variation across districts in the levels and trends of all indicators. Overall, composite coverage increased from 46% in 1990 to 73% in 2010, and most of this gain was attributable to the scale-up of malaria control interventions, pentavalent immunization, and exclusive breastfeeding. The scale-up of these interventions was relatively equitable across districts. In contrast, progress in routine services, including polio immunization, antenatal care, and skilled birth attendance, stagnated or declined and exhibited large disparities across districts. The absolute difference in composite coverage between the highest-performing and lowest-performing districts declined from 37 to 26 percentage points between 1990 and 2010, although considerable variation in composite coverage across districts persisted.CONCLUSIONS: Zambia has made marked progress in delivering maternal and child health interventions between 1990 and 2010; nevertheless, substantial variations across districts and interventions remained. Subnational benchmarking is important to identify these disparities, allowing policymakers to prioritize areas of greatest need. Analyses such as this one should be conducted regularly and feed directly into policy decisions in order to increase accountability at the local, regional, and national levels.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12916-015-0308-5"

Bacterial meningitis remains a common, often unrecognized and devastating illness in many African newborns with high mortality and morbidity. Further progress in reducing UFM has to focus on quality of care for neonates. Recent efforts to improve diagnosis, treatment and outcome are reviewed.RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnosis is often unsupported by laboratory tests and efforts have been made to improve the clinical diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Simpler, robust bedside tests are being devised. The cause of bacterial meningitis is changing and first-line antimicrobial therapy and adjuvant therapies are evaluated. Programmes to reduce risk factors and prevent neonatal infections are identified.SUMMARY: Neonatal care needs to improve in first referral hospitals with simple, low-cost, validated measures provided as bundles of care for both mother and child. First-line antibiotic therapy must be reconsidered in the light of increased infections by multiresistant and Gram-negative bacteria. Studies are needed for effective and safe lengths of antimicrobial therapy, the role of adjuvant therapy and the best anticonvulsants to use.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/QCO.0000000000000162"

Recent recommendations for cervical cancer primary prevention highlight HPV vaccination, and secondary prevention through screening. However, few studies have examined the different dimensions of health care access, and how these may influence screening behavior, especially in the context of clinical preventive services.METHODS: Using the 2003 South Africa World Health Survey, we determined the prevalence of cervical cancer screening with pelvic examinations and/or pap smears among women ages 18 years and older. We also examined the association between multiple dimensions of health care access and screening focusing on the affordability, availability, accessibility, accommodation and acceptability components.RESULTS: About 1 in 4 (25.3%, n = 65) of the women who attended a health care facility in the past year got screened for cervical cancer. Screened women had a significantly higher number of health care providers available compared with unscreened women (mean 125 vs.12, p-value &lt;0.001), and were more likely to have seen a medical doctor compared with nurses/midwives (73.1% vs. 45.9%, p-value = 0.003). In multivariable analysis, every unit increase in the number of health care providers available increased the likelihood of screening by 1% (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.01). In addition, seeing a nurse/midwife compared to a medical doctor reduced the likelihood of screening by 87% (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.42).CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cost issues (affordability component) and other patient level factors (captured in the acceptability, accessibility and accommodation components) were less important predictors of screening compared with availability of physicians in this population. Meeting cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination goals will require significant investments in the health care workforce, improving health care worker density in poor and rural areas, and improved training of the existing workforce.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12889-015-1686-5"

It is estimated to avert between 2 and 3 million deaths each year worldwide. The objective of this study was to assess complete immunization coverage and its associated factors among children aged 12 to 23 months in Sinana district, Bale Zone, Southeast Ethiopia.METHODS: A cross-sectional community based survey was conducted in Sinana district from December 2012 to January 2013. A modified World Health Organization-Expanded Program on Immunization cluster sampling methods were used for household selection. A total 591 children aged 12 to 23 months and their mothers or caregivers were included in the study. Data were collected by using a pre-tested, interviewer administered questionnaire. Bivariate analysis was employed to identify factors associated with full immunization coverage and multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for those factors that showed statistically significant association in bivariate analysis and investigate independent predictors by controlling for possible confounders and significances of all tests were decided at p-value of 0.05.RESULTS: More than three fourth (76.8%) of the children aged 12 to 23 months were fully vaccinated by card plus history. Factors significantly associated with full immunization were antenatal care follow up (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI: 2.3, 5.9), being a farmer (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.1), being father with secondary and above educational level (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.3, 7.4), having household family income greater than 1000 ETB or 52 USD (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.4, 7.4), those whose average walking time from home to health facilities is less than an hour (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.3), those who had ever discussed about immunization with health extension workers (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.2) and mothers' with sufficient knowledge on immunization (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.2).CONCLUSIONS: Even though, immunization coverage of children in Sinana district gets improvement over national coverage, yet it is below governmental plan to increase the coverage i.e. 90%. Maternal health care utilization and knowledge of mother about vaccine and vaccine preventable diseases are the main factors associated with complete immunization coverage.

In Kenya, &gt;50% of seropositive individuals are unaware of their status. Assisted partner notification is a public health strategy that provides HIV testing to individuals with sexual exposure to HIV and are at risk of infection and disease. This parallel, cluster-randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility of implementing HIV assisted partner notification services at HIV testing sites (clusters) in Kenya.DESIGN: Eighteen sites were selected among health facilities in Kenya with well-established, high-volume HIV testing programs, to reflect diverse communities and health-care settings. Restricted randomization was used to balance site characteristics between study arms (n = 9 per arm). Sixty individuals testing HIV positive ('index partners') will be enrolled per site (inclusion criteria: ≥18 years, positive HIV test at a study site, willing to disclose sexual partners, and never enrolled for HIV care; exclusion criteria: pregnancy or high risk of intimate partner violence). Index partners provide names and contact information for all sexual partners in the past 3 years. At intervention sites, study staff immediately contact sexual partners to notify them of exposure, offer HIV testing, and link to care if HIV seropositive. At control sites, passive partner referral is performed according to national guidelines, and assisted partner notification is delayed by 6 weeks. Primary outcomes, assessed 6 weeks after index partner enrollment and analyzed at the cluster level, are the number of partners accepting HIV testing and number of HIV infections diagnosed and linked to care per index partner. Secondary outcomes are the incremental cost-effectiveness of partner notification and the costs of identifying &gt;1 partner per index case. Participants are closely monitored for adverse outcomes, particularly intimate partner violence. The study is unblinded due to practical limitations.DISCUSSION: This rigorously designed trial will inform policy decisions regarding implementation of HIV partner notification services in Kenya, with possible application to other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Examination of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in diverse settings will enable targeted application and define best practices.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01616420 .","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s13012-015-0212-6"

This study aims to estimate the public health and economic burden of rabies circulating in domestic dog populations, globally and on a country-by-country basis, allowing an objective assessment of how much this preventable disease costs endemic countries.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We established relationships between rabies mortality and rabies prevention and control measures, which we incorporated into a model framework. We used data derived from extensive literature searches and questionnaires on disease incidence, control interventions and preventative measures within this framework to estimate the disease burden. The burden of rabies impacts on public health sector budgets, local communities and livestock economies, with the highest risk of rabies in the poorest regions of the world. This study estimates that globally canine rabies causes approximately 59,000 (95% Confidence Intervals: 25-159,000) human deaths, over 3.7 million (95% CIs: 1.6-10.4 million) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 8.6 billion USD (95% CIs: 2.9-21.5 billion) economic losses annually. The largest component of the economic burden is due to premature death (55%), followed by direct costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP, 20%) and lost income whilst seeking PEP (15.5%), with only limited costs to the veterinary sector due to dog vaccination (1.5%), and additional costs to communities from livestock losses (6%).SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that investment in dog vaccination, the single most effective way of reducing the disease burden, has been inadequate and that the availability and affordability of PEP needs improving. Collaborative investments by medical and veterinary sectors could dramatically reduce the current large, and unnecessary, burden of rabies on affected communities. Improved surveillance is needed to reduce uncertainty in burden estimates and to monitor the impacts of control efforts.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003709"

This paper estimated the supply chain and immunization service delivery costs and cost per dose in selected districts in Kenya and Tanzania. We also present operational data describing the supply chain and service delivery points (SDPs). To estimate the supply chain costs, we collected resource-use data for the cold chain, distribution system, and health worker time and per diems paid. We also estimated the service delivery costs, which included the time cost of health workers to provide immunization services, and per diems and transport costs for outreach sessions. Data on the annual quantities of vaccines distributed to each facility, and the occurrence and duration of stockouts were collected from stock registers. These data were collected from the national store, 2 regional and 4 district stores, and 12 SDPs in each country for 2012. Cost per dose for the supply chain and immunization service delivery were estimated. The average annual costs per dose at the SDPs were $0.34 (standard deviation (s.d.) $0.18) for Kenya when including only the vaccine supply chain costs, and $1.33 (s.d. $0.82) when including immunization service delivery costs. In Tanzania, these costs were $0.67 (s.d. $0.35) and $2.82 (s.d. $1.64), respectively. Both countries experienced vaccine stockouts in 2012, bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine being more likely to be stocked out in Kenya, and oral poliovirus vaccine in Tanzania. When stockouts happened, they usually lasted for at least one month. Tanzania made investments in 2011 in preparation for planned vaccine introductions, and their supply chain cost per dose is expected to decline with the new vaccine introductions. Immunization service delivery costs are a significant portion of the total costs at the SDPs.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25865467"

Successful immunization programs, however, depend on high vaccine acceptance and coverage rates. In recent years there has been an increased level of public concern towards real or perceived adverse events associated with immunizations, leading to many people in high- as well as low-resource settings to refuse vaccines. Health care workers therefore must be able to provide parents and guardians of children with the most current and accurate information about the benefits and risks of vaccination. Communicating vaccine safety using appropriate channels plays a crucial role in maintaining public trust and confidence in vaccination programs. Several factors render this endeavor especially challenging in low-resource settings where literacy rates are low and access to information is often limited. Many languages are spoken in most countries in low-resource settings, making the provision of appropriate information difficult. Poor infrastructure often results in inadequate logistics. Recently, some concerned consumer groups have been able to propagate misinformation and rumors. To successfully communicate vaccine safety in a resource limited setting it is crucial to use a mix of communication channels that are both culturally acceptable and effective. Social mobilization through cultural, administrative and political leaders, the media or text messages (SMS) as well as the adoption of the Village Health Team (VHT) strategy whereby trained community members (Community Health Workers (CHWs)) are providing primary healthcare, can all be effective in increasing the demand for immunization.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=CDS-66354"

As these countries struggle to keep pace with an ever growing number of vaccines, more and more Ministries of Health are considering options of engaging the private sector to manage vaccine storage, handling and distribution on their behalf. Despite this emerging trend, there is limited evidence on the benefits or challenges of this option to improve public supply chain performance for national immunization programmes. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study aims to shed light on the value proposition of outsourcing by documenting the specific experience of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The methodology for this review rested on conducting two key supply chain assessments which allowed juxtaposing the performance of the government managed segments of the vaccine supply chain against those managed by the private sector. In particular, measures of effective vaccine management best practice and temperature control in the cold chain were analysed. In addition, the costs of engaging the private sector were analysed to get a better understanding of the economics underpinning outsourcing vaccine logistics. The results from this analysis confirmed some of the theoretical benefits of outsourcing to the private sector. Yet, if the experience in the Western Cape can be deemed a successful one, there are several policy and practice implications that developing countries should be mindful of when considering engaging the private sector. While outsourcing can help improve the performance of the vaccine supply chain, it has the potential to do the reverse if done incorrectly. The findings and lessons learnt from the Western Cape experience can serve as a step towards understanding the role of the private sector in immunization supply chain and logistics systems for developing countries.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25819709"

Using the 2008-11 epidemic datasets, a retrospective longitudinal study was conducted to identify and quantify spatial and temporal environmental factors associated with RVF incidence. Cox regressions with a Besag model to account for the spatial effects were fitted to the data. Coefficients were estimated by Bayesian inference using integrated nested Laplace approximation. An increase in vegetation density was the most important risk factor until 2010. In 2010, increased temperature was the major risk factor. In 2011, after the large 2010 epidemic wave, these associations were reversed, potentially confounded by immunity in animals, probably resulting from earlier infection and vaccination. Both vegetation density and temperature should be considered together in the development of risk management strategies. However, the crucial need for improved access to data on population at risk, animal movements and vaccine use is highlighted to improve model predictions.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=srep09492"

A number of technologies exist for CD4 enumeration, with considerable variation in cost, complexity, and operational requirements. We conducted a systematic review of the performance of technologies for CD4 enumeration.METHODS AND FINDINGS: Studies were identified by searching electronic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE using a pre-defined search strategy. Data on test accuracy and precision included bias and limits of agreement with a reference standard, and misclassification probabilities around CD4 thresholds of 200 and 350 cells/μl over a clinically relevant range. The secondary outcome measure was test imprecision, expressed as % coefficient of variation. Thirty-two studies evaluating 15 CD4 technologies were included, of which less than half presented data on bias and misclassification compared to the same reference technology. At CD4 counts &lt;350 cells/μl, bias ranged from -35.2 to +13.1 cells/μl while at counts &gt;350 cells/μl, bias ranged from -70.7 to +47 cells/μl, compared to the BD FACSCount as a reference technology. Misclassification around the threshold of 350 cells/μl ranged from 1-29% for upward classification, resulting in under-treatment, and 7-68% for downward classification resulting in overtreatment. Less than half of these studies reported within laboratory precision or reproducibility of the CD4 values obtained.CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of bias and percent misclassification around treatment thresholds were reported on the CD4 enumeration technologies included in this review, with few studies reporting assay precision. The lack of standardised methodology on test evaluation, including the use of different reference standards, is a barrier to assessing relative assay performance and could hinder the introduction of new point-of-care assays in countries where they are most needed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0115019"

About half of under-5 deaths occur in only five countries: India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and China. By 2050, close to 40% of all live births will take place in Sub-Saharan Africa and 37% of the world's children under age five will live in the region. Most deaths can be attributable to preventable diseases. Pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria together killed roughly 2.2 million children under age five in 2012, accounting for a third of all under-five deaths. Emerging evidence has shown that children are at greater risk of dying before age five if they are born in rural areas, poor households, or to a mother denied basic education. While under-5 mortality was consistently reduced over the past 20 years, few progresses in reducing neonatal mortality as well as maternal mortality have been done. UNICEF is a leading partner in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), a far-reaching public-private partnership dedicated to increasing children's access to vaccines in poor countries. Early diagnosis and appropriate low-cost therapy of maternal and neonatal diseases are the challenges of the coming years. Therefore, there is the need to promote new experimental and clinical researches and to translate results in clinical practice. Laboratory medicine is strategic for promoting and validating innovative methods for managing the most important causes of maternal, neonatal and under-5 deaths, as well as to consistently reduce the gap between bench and bedside. This may be achieved by a close cooperation between laboratory medicine and industries for the development of new diagnostic tools, especially low-cost disposables easily usable by everyone, namely mothers, for an earlier and specific therapeutic treatments of such diseases like sepsis and infections.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25771105"

HPV was detected by PCR using modified GP5+/GP6+ (MGP) primers. Genotyping was performed by reverse-blot hybridisation, which allowed the detection of 9 of the 14 high-risk HPV types.RESULTS: Of the 181 samples, 91.7% were squamous cell carcinomas and 6.6% were adenocarcinomas. Counting all the single and multiple infections, the three most common high-risk types in descending order were HPV16 (88%), HPV45 (32%) and HPV18 (14.8%). 54.9% of cases were infected with a single HPV type and 45.1% had two or more HPV infections.CONCLUSIONS: The frequencies of HPV16, HPV45 and multiple infections are all higher than previously reported. These observations have significant implications on the consideration of vaccination strategies because each vaccine has different duration and efficacies in cross-protection of different HPV types.

Despite growing recognition that typhoid incidence in some areas of sub-Saharan Africa is similar to high-incidence areas of Asia, no large-scale typhoid vaccination campaigns have been conducted there. We performed an economic evaluation of a hypothetical one-time, fixed-post typhoid vaccination campaign in Kasese, a rural district in Uganda where a large, multi-year outbreak of typhoid fever has been reported.METHODS: We used medical cost and epidemiological data retrieved on-site and campaign costs from previous fixed-post vaccination campaigns in Kasese to account for costs from a public sector health care delivery perspective. We calculated program costs and averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and medical costs as a result of vaccination, to calculate the cost of the intervention per DALY and case averted.RESULTS: Over the 3 years of projected vaccine efficacy, a one-time vaccination campaign was estimated to avert 1768 (90%CI: 684-4431) typhoid fever cases per year and a total of 3868 (90%CI: 1353-9807) DALYs over the duration of the immunity conferred by the vaccine. The cost of the intervention per DALY averted was US$ 484 (90%CI: 18-1292) and per case averted US$ 341 (90%CI: 13-883).CONCLUSION: We estimated the vaccination campaign in this setting to be highly cost-effective, according to WHO's cost-effective guidelines. Results may be applicable to other African settings with similar high disease incidence estimates.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25712333"

Broader approaches for evaluating benefits of vaccination can be used to more accurately calculate the value of vaccination.METHODOLOGY: This paper reflects on the methodology of one such approach - the health investment life course approach - that looks at the impact of vaccine investment on lifetime returns. The role of this approach on vaccine decision-making will be assessed using the malaria health investment life course model example.RESULTS: We describe a framework that measures the impact of a health policy decision on government accounts over many generations. The methodological issues emerging from this approach are illustrated with an example from a recently completed health investment life course analysis of malaria vaccination in Ghana. Beyond the results, various conceptual and practical challenges of applying this framework to Ghana are discussed in this paper.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The current framework seeks to understand how disease and available technologies can impact a range of economic parameters such as labour force participation, education, healthcare consumption, productivity, wages or economic growth, and taxation following their introduction. The framework is unique amongst previous economic models in malaria because it considers future tax revenue for governments. The framework is complementary to cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis. The intent of this paper is to stimulate discussion on how existing and new methodology can add to knowledge regarding the benefits from investing in new and underutilized vaccines.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=25701316"

Over the past few decades, there has been considerable scientific activity in cancer in SA. However, there has been limited analysis of cancer scientific publications. In this paper, we present a protocol for bibliometric analysis of cancer research conducted in SA.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search of the journal databases PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and EBSCO will be conducted to identify and retrieve data from primary peer-reviewed cancer research articles using a set of consensus search words. Articles that involve cancer research conducted in SA or using biological or clinical data from South African participants and published between 2004 and 2014 will be included in the study. Two independent researchers will screen the articles for eligibility. Bibliometric indicators and study characteristics will be extracted, entered into a database and analysed. The cancer disease site will be recorded and research will be classified using the Common Scientific Outline system. Data obtained will be analysed to determine SA's publication productivity index in cancer research. Annual trends in bibliometric indicators and the type of cancer research will be determined. The degree of collaboration in research conducted in SA will be analysed using co-authorship matrix software. A publication to disease type ratio will be used to assess scientific production relative to disease burden.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this analysis will draw on publicly available data and does not directly involve human participants, ethical review is not required. We anticipate that the bibliometric analysis will identify the trends in cancer research productivity and the extent to which cancer research is aligned to the local burden of disease. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented in a user-friendly format to relevant policymakers and funders.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=bmjopen-2014-006913"

First, we argue that independent of any use of experimental drugs or vaccine interventions, simultaneous implementation of proven public health principles, community engagement and culturally sensitive communication are critical as these measures represent the most cost-effective and fair utilization of available resources. Second, we attempt to clarify the ethical issues related to use of scarce experimental drugs or vaccines and explore in detail the most critical ethical question related to Ebola drug or vaccine distribution in the current outbreak: who among those infected or at risk should be prioritized to receive any new experimental drugs or vaccines?

The diagnosis is easily missed. Laboratory tests are not routine and only confirm clinical suspicion. Rabies infection carries a case fatality exceeding 99.9%. Palliation is appropriate, except for previously-vaccinated patients or those infected by American bats, for whom intensive care is probably indicated. However, as rabies vaccines are outstandingly effective, no one should die of dog-transmitted infection. Vaccines and rabies immunoglobulin are expensive and usually scarce in Asia and Africa. All travellers to dog rabies enzootic areas should be strongly encouraged to have pre-exposure immunisation before departure. There is no contraindication to vaccination but the cost can be prohibitive. Intradermal immunisation, using 0.1 ml and sharing vials of vaccine, is cheaper and is now permitted by UK regulations. Returning travellers may need post-exposure prophylaxis. Economical intradermal post-exposure vaccination is practicable and should be introduced into rural areas of Africa and Asia immediately. Eliminating rabies in dogs is now feasible and would dramatically reduce human mortality, if funds were made available. The high current economic burden of human prophylaxis would then be largely relieved.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=15/1/78"

Results show that half of these countries reported having officially endorsed an NCCP and 42% were in the process of preparing or updating one. Overall, the most relevant cancer control interventions reported to be partially developed or well established in most countries were related to the cancer prevention, early detection of cervical and breast cancers, as well as diagnosis and treatment of curable cancers. Contrarily, patient's rehabilitation, psychosocial support, human papilloma virus vaccination, breast cancer screening with mammography and control of occupational carcinogens were noted as being in early development phases. The availability of crucial resources to support interventions was perceived to be the highest in upper middle-income countries.

Mass dog vaccination is considered to be the most effective method to prevent rabies in humans. Our objective was to systematically review research articles on dog rabies parenteral vaccination coverage in Africa in relation to dog accessibility and vaccination cost recovery arrangement (i.e.free of charge or owner charged).PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic literature search was made in the databases of CAB abstracts (EBSCOhost and OvidSP), Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline (EBSCOhost and OvidSP) and AJOL (African Journal Online) for peer reviewed articles on 1) rabies control, 2) dog rabies vaccination coverage and 3) dog demography in Africa. Identified articles were subsequently screened and selected using predefined selection criteria like year of publication (viz. ≥ 1990), type of study (cross sectional), objective(s) of the study (i.e. vaccination coverage rates, dog demographics and financial arrangements of vaccination costs), language of publication (English) and geographical focus (Africa). The selection process resulted in sixteen peer reviewed articles which were used to review dog demography and dog ownership status, and dog rabies vaccination coverage throughout Africa. The main review findings indicate that 1) the majority (up to 98.1%) of dogs in African countries are owned (and as such accessible), 2) puppies younger than 3 months of age constitute a considerable proportion (up to 30%) of the dog population and 3) male dogs are dominating in numbers (up to 3.6 times the female dog population).

The benefits would result from the removal of household resource and management costs that are traditionally incurred avoiding the disease. MCF, a fatal disease of cattle caused by a virus transmitted from wildebeest calves, has plagued Maasai communities in East Africa for generations. The threat of the disease forces the Maasai to move cattle to less productive grazing areas to avoid wildebeest during calving season when forage quality is critical. To assess the management and resource costs associated with moving, we used household survey data. To estimate the costs associated with changes in livestock body condition that result from being herded away from wildebeest calving grounds, we exploited an ongoing MCF vaccine field trial and we used a hedonic price regression, a statistical model that allows estimation of the marginal contribution of a good's attributes to its market price. We found that 90 percent of households move, on average, 82 percent of all cattle away from home to avoid MCF. In doing so, a herd's productive contributions to the household was reduced, with 64 percent of milk being unavailable for sale or consumption by the family members remaining at the boma (the children, women, and the elderly). In contrast cattle that remained on the wildebeest calving grounds during the calving season (and survived MCF) remained fully productive to the family and gained body condition compared to cattle that moved away. This gain was, however, short-lived. We estimated the market value of these condition gains and losses using hedonic regression. The value of a vaccine for MCF is the removal of the costs incurred in avoiding the disease.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0116059"

While these figures are cause for celebration, they must be interpreted carefully and with caution, particularly in relation to Africa. There are daunting challenges ahead for those working to achieve malaria eradication, not least of which is the poor quality of the data on which the work is based. In the absence of an affordable and fully effective vaccine, international funding for malaria control needs to be escalated still further. The money is essential to pay for universal access to a set of simple and proven interventions which would save the lives of millions of children over the next 15 years.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=archdischild-2013-305441"

Herein, we share our experience of establishing a BSL-3 culture facility in Uganda as well as 3-years performance indicators and post-TB vaccine trials (pioneer) and funding experience of sustaining such a facility.METHODS: Between September 2008 and April 2009, the laboratory was set-up with financial support from external partners. After an initial procedure validation phase in parallel with the National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL) and legal approvals, the laboratory registered for external quality assessment (EQA) from the NTRL, WHO, National Health Laboratories Services (NHLS), and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). The laboratory also instituted a functional quality management system (QMS). Pioneer funding ended in 2012 and the laboratory remained in self-sustainability mode.RESULTS: The laboratory achieved internationally acceptable standards in both structural and biosafety requirements. Of the 14 patient samples analyzed in the procedural validation phase, agreement for all tests with NTRL was 90% (P &lt;0.01). It started full operations in October 2009 performing smear microscopy, culture, identification, and drug susceptibility testing (DST). The annual culture workload was 7,636, 10,242, and 2,712 inoculations for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. Other performance indicators of TB culture laboratories were also monitored. Scores from EQA panels included smear microscopy &gt;80% in all years from NTRL, CAP, and NHLS, and culture was 100% for CAP panels and above regional average scores for all years with NHLS. Quarterly DST scores from WHO-EQA ranged from 78% to 100% in 2010, 80% to 100% in 2011, and 90 to 100% in 2012.CONCLUSIONS: From our experience, it is feasible to set-up a BSL-3 TB culture laboratory with acceptable quality performance standards in resource-limited countries. With the demonstrated quality of work, the laboratory attracted more research groups and post-pioneer funding, which helped to ensure sustainability. The high skilled experts in this research laboratory also continue to provide an excellent resource for the needed national discussion of the laboratory and quality management systems.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=1478-4505-13-4"

Despite global progress in adolescent health, many adolescents in Africa still get sick and die from vaccine-preventable diseases due to lack of vaccination. Adolescents, parents and teachers are key players in the development and implementation of adolescent vaccination policies. Optimal knowledge, attitudes and practices towards adolescent vaccination among these key players may improve vaccine uptake among adolescents. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative systematic review on knowledge, attitudes and practices of adolescent vaccination among adolescents, parents and teachers in Africa.METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, WHOLIS, Africa Wide and CINAHL for eligible quantitative and qualitative primary studies with no time limits. We also checked reference lists of included studies for eligible studies and searched grey literature. Two authors independently screened the search outputs, selected studies and extracted data; resolving discrepancies by consensus and discussion. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analyses where applicable, while analyses from quantitative studies used different methods based on the type of outcomes.RESULTS: We included 18 cross-sectional studies in this review. The included studies were conducted in 10 out of the 54 countries in Africa. The 18 studies focused on a wide range of adolescent vaccines. Thirteen studies evaluated vaccines against Human Papilloma Virus, while each of the remaining 5 studies, evaluated vaccines against rabies, HIV, tetanus toxoid, tuberculosis and adolescent vaccines in general. Among the key players, we found low to moderate levels of knowledge about adolescent vaccination. Positive attitudes and practices towards adolescent vaccination, especially against Human Papilloma Virus were reported. Despite the low knowledge, our results showed high levels of acceptability to adolescent vaccination among adolescents, parents and teachers.CONCLUSIONS: It was evident in our review that all key demographics (parents, adolescents and teachers) were receptive towards adolescent vaccines. We propose relevant policy makers in Africa to consider continuous education programs such as those aimed to inform the parents, adolescents and teachers on adolescent vaccination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0264-410X(16)30437-6"

Periodic home HTC, particularly targeted to those with high HIV viral load, might facilitate expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage. We used a mathematical model to assess the effect of periodic home HTC programmes on HIV incidence in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.METHODS: We developed a dynamic HIV transmission model with parameters, primary cost data, and measures of viral suppression collected from a prospective study of home HTC in KwaZulu-Natal. In our model, we assumed home HTC took place every 5 years with ART initiation for people with CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL or less. For individuals with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL, we compared increasing ART coverage for those with 350-500 cells per μL with initiating treatment for those who have viral loads of more than 10 000 copies per mL.FINDINGS: Maintaining the presently observed level of 36% viral suppression in HIV-positive people, HIV incidence decreases by 33·8% over 10 years. Home HTC every 5 years with linkage to care with ART initiation at CD4 counts of 350 cells per μL or less reduces HIV incidence by 40·6% over 10 years. Expansion of ART to people with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL who also have a viral load of 10 000 copies per mL or more decreases HIV incidence by 51·6%, and this was the most cost-effective strategy for prevention of HIV infections at US$2960 per infection averted. Expansion of ART eligibility CD4 counts of 350-500 cells per μL is cost-effective at $900 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Following health economic guidelines, expansion of ART use to individuals who have viral loads of more than 10 000 copies per mL among those with CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL was cost-effective to reduce HIV-related morbidity.INTERPRETATION: Our results show that province-wide home HTC every 5 years can be a cost-effective strategy to increase ART coverage and reduce HIV burden. Expanded ART initiation criteria that includes individuals with high viral load will improve the effectiveness of home HTC in linking individuals to ART who are at high risk of transmitting HIV, thereby preventing morbidity and onward transmission.FUNDING: National Institutes of Health.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S2352-3018(16)30009-1"

Understanding the costs associated with the management of childhood pneumonia is essential for resource allocation and priority setting for child health.METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to identify studies reporting data on the cost of management of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years old. We collected unpublished cost data on non-severe, severe and very severe pneumonia through collaboration with an international working group. We extracted data on cost per episode, duration of hospital stay and unit cost of interventions for the management of pneumonia. The mean (95% confidence interval, CI) and median (interquartile range, IQR) treatment costs were estimated and reported where appropriate.RESULTS: We identified 24 published studies eligible for inclusion and supplemented these with data from 10 unpublished studies. The 34 studies included in the cost analysis contained data on more than 95 000 children with pneumonia from both low- and-middle income countries (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC) covering all 6 WHO regions. The total cost (per episode) for management of severe pneumonia was US$ 4.3 (95% CI 1.5-8.7), US$ 51.7 (95% CI 17.4-91.0) and US$ 242.7 (95% CI 153.6-341.4)-559.4 (95% CI 268.9-886.3) in community, out-patient facilities and different levels of hospital in-patient settings in LMIC. Direct medical cost for severe pneumonia in hospital inpatient settings was estimated to be 26.6%-115.8% of patients' monthly household income in LMIC. The mean direct non-medical cost and indirect cost for severe pneumonia management accounted for 0.5-31% of weekly household income. The mean length of stay (LOS) in hospital for children with severe pneumonia was 5.8 (IQR 5.3-6.4) and 7.7 (IQR 5.5-9.9) days in LMIC and HIC respectively for these children.CONCLUSION: This is the most comprehensive review to date of cost data from studies on the management of childhood pneumonia and these data should be helpful for health services planning and priority setting by national programmes and international agencies.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.7189/jogh.06.010408"

Investment in GBS disease prevention, such as maternal vaccination, requires evidence of disease burden, particularly in high infant mortality regions like sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to provide such evidence by conducting a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to estimate maternal colonization proportion, GBS disease incidence, and GBS serotype distribution.METHODS: MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies published 1990 - 2014, pertaining to sub-Saharan Africa. Eligible studies were used to estimate the proportion of pregnant women colonized with GBS, early-onset GBS (EOGBS) disease incidence, late-onset GBS (LOGBS) disease incidence, and respective serotype distributions. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate weighted means and confidence intervals.RESULTS: We identified 17 studies of colonization, nine of disease incidence, and six of serotype distribution meeting inclusion criteria. 21.8% (95% CI 18.3, 25.5) of expectant women were colonized with GBS. The incidence of EOGBS disease was 1.3 per 1000 births (95% CI 0.81, 1.9), that of LOGBS disease 0.73 per 1000 births (95% CI 0.48, 1.0). The most common disease-causing serotype was 3, followed by 1a. Serotypes 1b, 2 and 5 were next most common in frequency.CONCLUSION: Despite methodologic factors leading to under-estimation, GBS disease incidence appears high in sub-Saharan Africa. A small number of GBS serotypes cause almost all disease. GBS disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that safe, effective, and affordable GBS disease prevention is needed.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/INF.0000000000001233"

A large proportion of these deaths occurred in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Immunization is one way to reduce childhood morbidity and deaths. In Nigeria, however, although immunization is provided without a charge at public facilities, coverage remains low and deaths from vaccine preventable diseases are high. This article seeks to assess inequalities in full and partial immunization coverage in Nigeria. It also assesses inequality in the 'intensity' of immunization coverage and it explains the factors that account for disparities in child immunization coverage in the country. Using nationally representative data, this article shows that disparities exist in the coverage of immunization to the advantage of the rich. Also, factors such as mother's literacy, region and location of the child, and socio-economic status explain the disparities in immunization coverage in Nigeria. Apart from addressing these issues, the article notes the importance of addressing other social determinants of health to reduce the disparities in immunization coverage in the country. These should be in line with the social values of communities so as to ensure acceptability and compliance. We argue that any policy that addresses these issues will likely reduce disparities in immunization coverage and put Nigeria on the road to sustainable development.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=czw053"

RP was the first animal disease to be globally eradicated in 2011 and is only the second disease, after smallpox, to have ever been eradicated. PPR is one of the principal constraints to small ruminant production in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The epidemiology of PPR and RP as well as the technologies available for their diagnosis and control are similar. The conditions that favored the eradication of RP are also largely present for PPR. In this work, we outline the evolving strategy for eradication in light of current opportunities and challenges, as well as the lessons from other eradication programs in animal and human health.

Yet FMD impact on smallholders in these regions is poorly understood. Diseases of low mortality can exert a large impact if incidence is high. Modelling and field studies commonly find high FMD incidence in endemic countries. Sero-surveys typically find a third of young cattle are sero-positive, however, the proportion of sero-positive animals that developed disease, and resulting impact, are unknown. The few smallholder FMD impact studies that have been performed assessed different aspects of impact, using different approaches. They find that FMD impact can be high (&gt;10% of annual household income). However, impact is highly variable, being a function of FMD incidence and dependency on activities affected by FMD. FMD restricts investment in productive but less FMD-resilient farming methods, however, other barriers to efficient production may exist, reducing the benefits of FMD control. Applying control measures is costly and can have wide-reaching negative impacts; veterinary-cordon-fences may damage wildlife populations, and livestock movement restrictions and trade bans damage farmer profits and the wider economy. When control measures are ineffective, farmers, society and wildlife may experience the burden of control without reducing disease burden. Foot-and-mouth disease control has benefitted smallholders in South America and elsewhere. Success takes decades of regional cooperation with effective veterinary services and widespread farmer participation. However, both the likelihood of success and the full cost of control measures must be considered. Controlling FMD in smallholder systems is challenging, particularly when movement restrictions are hard to enforce. In parts of Africa this is compounded by endemically infected wildlife and limited vaccine performance. This paper reviews FMD impact on smallholders in endemic countries. Significant evidence gaps exist and guidance on the design of FMD impact studies is provided.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27167976"

This study was conducted to review practices/measures and challenges in the Sub-Saharan region relating to vaccination of health workers against HBV. We performed a literature review of articles addressing any aspect of HBV vaccination of health workers in the Sub-Saharan region sourced from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, including a case study of Malawi policies and strategies in training institutions and facilities. Our findings indicated that HBV awareness and vaccination were relatively high, but vaccination rates were lower, with 4.6-64.4% of those &quot;ever vaccinated&quot; completing the vaccination regimen. There was also great variation in the proportion of health workers exhibiting natural immunity from previous exposure (positive for anti-Hepatitis B core antibodies; 41-92%). Commonly cited reasons for non-uptake of vaccine included cost, lack of awareness of vaccine availability, and inadequate information concerning the vaccine. Countries in this region will require locally relevant data to develop cost-effective strategies that maximize the benefit to their health workers due to the great diversity of HBV epidemiology in the region.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S2210-6006(15)30044-7"

Control measures can be broadly grouped into community health education, improvements in hygiene and sanitary conditions, proper meat handling at household and community level, improved standards of meat inspection, pig management, treatment of individual patients and possibly human populations, and treatment and/or vaccination of porcine populations. This manuscript looks critically into currently existing control options and provides suggestions on which (combination of) tools would be most effective in the control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in sub-Saharan Africa. Field data and disease transmission simulations suggest that implementation of a single intervention control strategy will not lead to a satisfactory reduction of disease morbidity or transmission. A feasible strategy to combat T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis would include a combination of approaches focussing on both human (health education and treatment) and animal host (management, treatment and vaccination), which can vary for different communities and different geographical locations. Selection of the specific strategy depends on cost-effectiveness analyses based on solid field data, currently unavailable, though urgently needed; as well as on health priorities and resources of the country. A One Health approach involving medical, veterinary, environmental and social sectors is essential for T. solium to be controlled and eventually eliminated. Finally the success of any intervention is largely dependent on the level of societal and political acceptance, commitment and engagement.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27140860"

The projected cost of delivering Cervarix to female learners at two or three doses over the period 2014 - 2018, adjusted for inflation, was ZAR172 717 342 and ZAR250 048 426, respectively. Similarly, the cost for Gardasil at these doses was ZAR197 482 200 and ZAR287 194 361, respectively. For male and female learners the cost for Cervarix over this period at two or three doses was ZAR337 101 132 and ZAR540 150 713, respectively. Similarly, the cost for Gardasil at these doses was ZAR426 597 971 and ZAR620 392 784, respectively. Accounting for population variation for females over 5 years, the cost of two doses of Cervarix ranged from ZAR168 888 677 to ZAR 176 545 977 at the lower and upper 95% confidence intervals (CIs), respectively. For three doses the cost ranged from ZAR244 505 544 to ZAR255 591 263 at the lower and upper 95% CIs, respectively.

The sizeable disease burden in West Africa, numerous imported LF cases worldwide, and the possibility that LASV can be used as an agent of biological warfare make a strong case for vaccine development. There are no licensed LASV vaccines and the antiviral treatment is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective.AREAS COVERED: LASV vaccine development is hampered by high cost of biocontainment requirement, the absence of appropriate small animal models, genetic diversity of LASV species, and by high HIV-1 prevalence in LASV endemic areas. Over the past 15 years several vaccine platforms have been developed. Natural history of LASV and pathogenesis of the disease provide strong justification for replication-competent (RC) vaccine as one of the most feasible approaches to control LF. Development of LASV vaccine candidates based on reassortant, recombinant, and alphavirus replicon technologies is covered in this review. Expert commentary: Two lead RC vaccine candidates, reassortant ML29 and recombinant VSV/LASV, have been successfully tested in non-human primates and have been recommended by international vaccine experts for rapid clinical development. Both platforms have powerful molecular tools to further secure safety, improve immunogenicity, and cross-protection. These platforms are well positioned to design multivalent vaccines to protect against all LASV strains citculatrd in West Africa. The regulatory pathway of Candid #1, the first live-attenuated arenaviral vaccine against Argentine hemorrhagic, will be a reasonable guideline for LASV vaccine efficacy trials.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27136941"

The HIV vaccination of adolescents could reduce HIV incidence and mortality. The potential impact and cost-effectiveness of a national school-based HIV vaccination program among adolescents was determined.METHOD: The national HIV disease and cost burden was compared with (intervention) and without HIV vaccination (comparator) given to school-going adolescents using a semi-Markov model. Life table analysis was conducted to determine the impact of the intervention on life expectancy. Model inputs included measures of disease and cost burden and hypothetical assumptions of vaccine characteristics. The base-case HIV vaccine modelled cost at US$ 12 per dose; vaccine efficacy of 50 %; duration of protection of 10 years achieved at a coverage rate of 60 % and required annual boosters. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated using life years gained (LYG) serving as the outcome measure. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the vaccine characteristics to assess parameter uncertainty.RESULTS: The HIV vaccination model yielded an ICER of US$ 5 per LYG (95 % CI ZAR 2.77-11.61) compared with the comparator, which is considerably less than the national willingness-to-pay threshold of cost-effectiveness. This translated to an 11 % increase in per capita costs from US$ 80 to US$ 89. National implementation of this intervention could potentially result in an estimated cumulative gain of 23.6 million years of life (95 % CI 8.48-34.3 million years) among adolescents age 10-19 years that were vaccinated. The 10 year absolute risk reduction projected by vaccine implementation was 0.42 % for HIV incidence and 0.41 % for HIV mortality, with an increase in life expectancy noted across all age groups. The ICER was sensitive to the vaccine efficacy, coverage and vaccine pricing in the sensitivity analysis.CONCLUSIONS: A national HIV vaccination program would be cost-effective and would avert new HIV infections and decrease the mortality and morbidity associated with HIV disease. Decision makers would have to discern how these findings, derived from local data and reflective of the South African epidemic, can be integrated into the national long term health planning should a HIV vaccine become available.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12889-016-2959-3"

We sought to determine monovalent rotavirus vaccine cost-effectiveness in Malawi, one of Africa's poorest countries and the first Gavi-eligible country to report disease reduction following introduction in 2012.METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of children with acute gastroenteritis at a rural primary health center, a rural first referral-level hospital and an urban regional referral hospital in Malawi. For each participant we itemized household costs of illness and direct medical expenditures incurred. We also collected Ministry of Health vaccine implementation costs. Using a standard tool (TRIVAC), we derived cost-effectiveness.RESULTS: Between 1 January 2013 and 21 November 2014, we recruited 530 children aged &lt;5 years with gastroenteritis. Costs did not differ by rotavirus test result, but were significantly higher for admitted children and those with increased severity on Vesikari scale. Adding rotavirus vaccine to the national schedule costs Malawi $0.42 per dose in system costs. Vaccine copayment is an additional $0.20. Over 20 years, the vaccine program will avert 1 026 000 cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis, 78 000 inpatient admissions, 4300 deaths, and 136 000 disability-adjusted-life-years (DALYs). For this year's birth cohort, it will avert 54 000 cases of rotavirus and 281 deaths in children aged &lt;5 years. The program will cost $10.5 million and save $8.0 million in averted healthcare costs. Societal cost per DALY averted was $10, and the cost per rotavirus case averted was $1.CONCLUSIONS: Gastroenteritis causes substantial economic burden to Malawi. The rotavirus vaccine program is highly cost-effective. Together with the demonstrated impact of rotavirus vaccine in reducing population hospitalization burden, its cost-effectiveness makes a strong argument for widespread utilization in other low-income, high-burden settings.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=civ1025"

Despite previous failures, there is renewed optimism about developing an efficacious HIV prophylactic vaccine following the 31.2% vaccine efficacy (modified intention to treat analysis) achieved in the RV-144 trial. Intense efforts at characterising the immune responses in the trial participants who appeared to gain some protection from the candidate vaccine are ongoing to delineate correlates of protection. However, the characteristics of a vaccine suitable for programmatic introduction in high prevalence areas remain undefined.AIMS: We set out to ascertain the vaccination policies and strategies that policy makers involved in vaccine introductions would advise were a candidate HIV vaccine to become available.METHODS: Structured questionnaires in both English and French were self-administered to consenting policy makers such as members of National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups. Members from three out of the six WHO regional groups were purposively reached for their responses.RESULTS: Thirty-seven key opinion leaders were approached through self-administered questionnaires delivered by e-mail or in person. Nine responses were received, representing a 24.3% response rate. The responses received were from three [Africa (6), Americas (1) and Europe (2)] out of the six WHO regions. All respondents would prioritise the vaccination of commercial sex workers over other risk groups if there was an efficacious HIV vaccine. Vaccine efficacy was considered to be the most important factor, ahead of vaccine safety and cost, in determining the acceptability of a new prophylactic HIV vaccine.CONCLUSIONS: It is expected that the first generation HIV vaccines may be modestly efficacious. However, even a modestly efficacious vaccine might curtail the spread of HIV if universal or near-universal coverage is achieved. It is important to anticipate policy discussions which would influence how rapidly an HIV vaccine would be rolled-out programmatically to achieve maximum impact.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27055022"

More than 75 % of HIV-infected people are in Africa, and most of them are unaware of their HIV status, which is a barrier to accessing antiretroviral treatment. Our review aims, firstly, to determine whether HIV self-testing is an effective method to increase the uptake of testing, the yield of new HIV-positive diagnoses, and the linkage to antiretroviral treatment. Secondly, we aim to review the factors that facilitate or impede the uptake of HIV self-testing.DESIGN: Participants will be adults living in Africa. For the first aim, the intervention will be HIV self-testing either alone or in addition to HIV testing standard of care. The comparison will be HIV testing standard of care. The primary outcomes will be (i) uptake of HIV testing and (ii) yield of new HIV-positive diagnoses. The secondary outcomes will be (a) linkage to antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and (b) incidence of social harms. For the second aim, we will review barriers and facilitators to the uptake of self-testing. We will search PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, Web of Science, WHOLIS, Africa Wide, and CINAHL for eligible studies from 1998, with no language limits. We will check reference lists of included studies for other eligible reports. Eligible studies will include experimental and observational studies. Two authors will independently screen the search output, select studies, and extract data, resolving discrepancies by consensus and discussion. Two authors will use Cochrane risk of bias tools for experimental studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for observational studies, and the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) quality assessment tool for qualitative studies.DISCUSSION: Innovative and cost-effective community-based HIV testing strategies, such as self-testing, will contribute to universal coverage of HIV testing in Africa.

Burkina Faso's first dengue epidemic occurred in 1925 and the most recent in 2013. Yet there is still very little known about dengue prevalence, its vector proliferation, and its poverty and equity impacts.METHODS: An exploratory cross-sectional survey was performed from December 2013 to January 2014. Six primary healthcare centers in Ouagadougou were selected based on previously reported presence of Flavivirus. All patients consulting with fever or having had fever within the previous week and with a negative rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria were invited to participate. Sociodemographic data, healthcare use and expenses, mobility, health-related status, and vector control practices were captured using a questionnaire. Blood samples of every eligible subject were obtained through finger pricks during the survey for dengue RDT using SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo (NS1Ag and IgG/IgM)® and to obtain blood spots for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. In a sample of randomly selected yards and those of patients, potential Aedes breeding sites were found and described. Larvae were collected and brought to the laboratory to monitor the emergence of adults and identify the species.RESULTS: Of the 379 subjects, 8.7 % (33/379) had positive RDTs for dengue. Following the 2009 WHO classification, 38.3 % (145/379) had presumptive, probable, or confirmed dengue, based on either clinical symptoms or laboratory testing. Of 60 samples tested by RT-PCR (33 from the positive tests and 27 from the subsample of negatives), 15 were positive. The serotypes observed were DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4. Odds of dengue infection in 15-to-20-year-olds and persons over 50 years were 4.0 (CI 95 %: 1.0-15.6) and 7.7 (CI 95 %: 1.6-37.1) times higher, respectively, than in children under five. Average total spending for a dengue episode was 13 771 FCFA [1 300-67 300 FCFA] (1$US = 478 FCFA). On average, 2.6 breeding sites were found per yard. Potential Aedes breeding sites were found near 71.4 % (21/28) of patients, but no adult Aedes were found. The most frequently identified potential breeding sites were water storage containers (45.2 %). Most specimens collected in yards were Culex (97.9 %).CONCLUSIONS: The scientific community, public health authorities, and health workers should consider dengue as a possible cause of febrile illness in Burkina Faso.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s40249-016-0120-2"

The global incidence of NTS gastroenteritis in 2010 was estimated to be 93 million cases, approximately 80 million of which were contracted via food-borne transmission. It is estimated that 155,000 deaths resulted from NTS in 2010. NTS also causes severe, extra-intestinal, invasive bacteremia, referred to as invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease. iNTS disease usually presents as a febrile illness, frequently without gastrointestinal symptoms, in both adults and children. Symptoms of iNTS are similar to malaria, often including fever (&gt;90%) and splenomegaly (&gt;40%). The underlying reasons for the high rates of iNTS disease in Africa are still being elucidated. Evidence from animal and human studies supports the feasibility of developing a safe and effective vaccine against iNTS. Both antibodies and complement can kill Salmonella species in vitro. Proof-of-principle studies in animal models have demonstrated efficacy for live attenuated and subunit vaccines that target the O-antigens, flagellin proteins, and other outer membrane proteins of serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis. More recently, a novel delivery strategy for NTS vaccines has been developed: the Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA) technology which presents surface polysaccharides and outer membrane proteins in their native conformation. GMMA technology is self-adjuvanting, as it delivers multiple pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules. GMMA may be particularly relevant for low- and middle-income countries as it has the potential for high immunologic potency at a low cost and involves a relatively simple production process without the need for complex conjugation. Several vaccines for the predominant NTS serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis, are currently under development.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27032517"

In this study, it is demonstrated that two antigens of P. falciparum UB05, UB09 and their chimera UB05-09 can serve as protective immunity markers by eliciting higher T-cell responses in malaria semi-immune subjects (SIS) than in frequently sick subjects (FSS) and could be used to distinguish these two groups. UB05, UB09 and UB05-09 were cloned, expressed in E. coli, purified and used to stimulate PBMCs isolated from 63 subjects in a malaria endemic area, for IFN-γ production, which was measured by the ELISpot assay. The polymorphism of UB09 gene in the malaria infected population was also studied by PCR/sequencing of the gene in P. falciparum field isolates. All three antigens were preferentially recognized by PBMCs from SIS. IFN-γ production induced by these antigens correlated with the absence of fever and parasitaemia. UB09 was shown to be relatively well-conserved in nature. It is concluded that UB05, UB09 and the chimera UB05-09 posses T-cell epitopes that are associated with protection against malaria and could thus be used to distinguish SIS from FSS eventhough acute infection with malaria has been shown to reduce cytokine production in some studies. Further investigations of these antigens as potential diagnostic and/or vaccine candidates for malaria are indicated.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27012849"

Despite the availability of safe and cost effective vaccine, measles remained endemic with persistent periodic outbreaks in the Horn of Africa. The aim of this study is to characterize laboratory confirmed measles cases in Amhara Regional State, which was one of the highly affected regions in Ethiopia.METHOD: A suspected measles case was defined as any person presenting with fever, maculopapular rash and one or more of the three symptoms cough, coryza or conjunctivitis or a patient in whom a clinician suspects measles. A blood sample was collected for any measles suspected patient with a case based investigation form and specimen transported to the National Measles Laboratory in good condition where it was to be tested for Measles IgM antibody by ELISA technique.

To address this gap in information, the Typhoid Fever Surveillance in Africa Program (TSAP) founded a surveillance system for TF in 10 African countries. This study was a component of the TSAP surveillance project in Madagascar.METHODS: The study entailed a qualitative assessment of patients' experiences and perceptions of services for febrile symptoms at the studies' rural and urban sentinel public health clinics. The study examined influences on the use of these facilities, alternative sources of care, and providers' descriptions of medical consultations and challenges in providing services. Data were collected through semistructured and open-ended individual interviews and a focus group with patients, caregivers, and medical personnel.RESULTS: Thirty-three patients and 12 healthcare providers participated in the data collection across the 2 healthcare facilities. The quality of services, cost, and travel distance were key factors that enabled access to and use of these clinics. Divergent healthcare-seeking patterns were related to variability in the care utilized, socioeconomic status, and potential distance from the facilities : These factors influenced delivery of care, patient access, and the health facilities' capacity to identify cases of febrile illness such as TF.CONCLUSIONS: This approach provided an in-depth investigation and understanding of healthcare-seeking behavior at the study facilities, and factors that facilitated or acted as barriers to their use. Our findings demonstrate the relevance of these public health clinics as sites for the surveillance of TF in their role as central healthcare sources for families and communities within these rural and urban areas of Madagascar.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=civ892"

Most deaths occur after being bitten by a rabid dog. Those exposed to a suspect rabid animal should receive appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or risk death. However, vaccination of dogs to control and eliminate canine rabies at the source has been implemented in many places around the world. Here, we analysed the vaccination and cost data for one such campaign in the area surrounding and including Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and estimated the cost per dog vaccinated. We also estimated the cost of human PEP. We found that the cost per dog vaccinated ranged from $2.50 to $22.49 across districts and phases, with the phase average ranging from $7.30 to $11.27. These figures were influenced by over purchase of vaccine in the early phases of the programme and the significant costs associated with purchasing equipment for a programme starting from scratch. The cost per human PEP course administered was approximately $24.41, with the average patient receiving 2.5 of the recommended four vaccine doses per suspect bite. This study provides valuable financial insights into programme managers and policymakers working towards rabies elimination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1111/tbed.12463"

Despite control efforts in a number of countries, it has continued to spread across Africa and Asia, placing an increasing burden on the livelihoods of livestock keepers and on veterinary resources in affected countries. Given the similarities between PPR and rinderpest, and the lessons learned from the successful global eradication of rinderpest, the eradication of PPR seems appealing, both eliminating an important disease and improving the livelihoods of the poor in developing countries. We conducted a benefit-cost analysis to examine the economic returns from a proposed programme for the global eradication of PPR. Based on our knowledge and experience, we developed the eradication strategy and estimated its costs. The benefits of the programme were determined from (i) the averted mortality costs, based on an analysis of the literature, (ii) the downstream impact of reduced mortality using a social accounting matrix, and (iii) the avoided control costs based on current levels of vaccination. The results of the benefit-cost analysis suggest strong economic returns from PPR eradication. Based on a 15-year programme with total discounted costs of US$2.26 billion, we estimate discounted benefits of US$76.5 billion, yielding a net benefit of US$74.2 billion. This suggests a benefit cost ratio of 33.8, and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 199%. As PPR mortality rates are highly variable in different populations, we conducted a sensitivity analysis based on lower and higher mortality scenarios. All the scenarios examined indicate that investment in PPR eradication would be highly beneficial economically. Furthermore, removing one of the major constraints to small ruminant production would be of considerable benefit to many of the most vulnerable communities in Africa and Asia.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0149982"

However, increasing drug and insecticide resistance threatens the successes made with existing methods. Insecticide resistance has decreased the efficacy of the most commonly used insecticide class of pyrethroids. This decreased efficacy has increased mosquito survival, which is a prelude to rising incidence of malaria and fatalities. Despite intensive research efforts, new insecticides will not reach the market for at least 5 years. Elimination of malaria is not possible without effective mosquito control. Therefore, to combat the threat of resistance, key stakeholders need to rapidly embrace a multifaceted approach including a reduction in the cost of bringing new resistance management methods to market and the streamlining of associated development, policy, and implementation pathways to counter this looming public health catastrophe.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=S0140-6736(15)00417-1"

Data gaps make it difficult to map how well countries have done in spending government resources on immunization to demonstrate greater ownership of programs. This article presents findings of an innovative approach for financial mapping of routine immunization applied in Benin, Ghana, Honduras, Moldova, Uganda, and Zambia. This approach uses modified System of Health Accounts coding to evaluate data collected from national and subnational levels and from donor agencies. We found that government sources accounted for 27-95 percent of routine immunization financing in 2011, with countries that have higher gross national product per capita better able to finance requirements. Most financing is channeled through government agencies and used at the primary care level. Sustainable immunization programs will depend upon whether governments have the fiscal space to allocate additional resources. Ongoing robust analysis of routine immunization should be instituted within the context of total health expenditure tracking.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=35/2/259"

Unyielding HIV subepidemics among adolescents threaten national attempts to curtail the disease burden. Should an HIV vaccine become available, establishing its point of entry into the health system becomes a priority. This study assesses the impact of school-based HIV vaccination and explores how variations in vaccine characteristics affect cost-effectiveness. The cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained associated with school-based adolescent HIV vaccination services was assessed using Markov modeling that simulated annual cycles based on national costing data. The estimation was based on a life expectancy of 70 years and employs the health care provider perspective. The simultaneous implementation of HIV vaccination services with current HIV management programs would be cost-effective, even at relatively higher vaccine cost. At base vaccine cost of US$ 12, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$ 43 per QALY gained, with improved ICER values yielded at lower vaccine costs. The ICER was sensitive to duration of vaccine mediated protection and variations in vaccine efficacy. Data from this work demonstrate that vaccines offering longer duration of protection and at lower cost would result in improved ICER values. School-based HIV vaccine services of adolescents, in addition to current HIV prevention and treatment health services delivered, would be cost-effective.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1097/MD.0000000000002528"

Although traditionally understood to affect primarily sheep and goats, it is also the predominant Brucella species that affects cows in some endemic areas. Despite this, no licensed vaccine is available specifically for use against B. melitensis in cows. The mainstay of most control programs is vaccination of sheep and goats with a live vaccine, Rev-1. The aim of this study was to investigate how critical vaccination of cows might be, in order to control B. melitensis on a mixed sheep-and-cattle farm.METHODS: A dynamic, differential-equation, age-structured, seasonal model with births and deaths, was used to investigate whether vaccination of both sheep and cattle had an impact on time to elimination of brucellosis on an individual mixed species farm, when compared to vaccination of sheep only. The model was a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) model with an additional compartment for Persistently Infected (PI) individuals. Transmission parameters were fit based on a nation-wide probabilistic seroprevalence survey in Jordan.RESULTS: The model predicted that it would take 3.5 years to eliminate brucellosis (to less than 0.5% of adult sheep seropositive as a result of infection) on a mixed-species B. melitensis-endemic farm with the median field-study seroprevalence, following vaccination of both sheep and cattle, assuming a vaccine effectiveness of 80%. Limiting the vaccination to sheep only, increased the time to 16.8 years. Sensitivity analysis showed that the finding that vaccination of cattle was of significant importance, was robust. Vaccine effectiveness had a strong influence on time to elimination.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of further data, vaccination of cattle should be considered essential in Brucella-endemic settings where mixed small ruminant and cattle flocks predominate. Further evidence that Brucella melitensis predominates in cattle in Jordan, as opposed to Brucella abortus, is needed in order to validate this model. The results may be applicable to other mixed-species settings with similar livestock management practices. These methods may be applied to other pathogens affecting multiple livestock species or with seasonal transmission.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s13071-016-1327-6"

This outbreak has been characterised by extensive geographic spread across the affected countries Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and by localized hotspots within these countries. The rapid recognition and quantitative assessment of localised areas of higher transmission can inform the optimal deployment of public health resources.METHODS: A variety of mathematical models have been used to estimate the evolution of this epidemic, and some have pointed out the importance of the spatial heterogeneity apparent from incidence maps. However, little is known about the district-level transmission. Given that many response decisions are taken at sub-national level, the current study aimed to investigate the spatial heterogeneity by using a different modelling framework, built on publicly available data at district level. Furthermore, we assessed whether this model could quantify the effect of intervention measures and provide predictions at a local level to guide public health action. We used a two-stage modelling approach: a) a flexible spatiotemporal growth model across all affected districts and b) a deterministic SEIR compartmental model per district whenever deemed appropriate.FINDINGS: Our estimates show substantial differences in the evolution of the outbreak in the various regions of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, illustrating the importance of monitoring the outbreak at district level. We also provide an estimate of the time-dependent district-specific effective reproduction number, as a quantitative measure to compare transmission between different districts and give input for informed decisions on control measures and resource allocation. Prediction and assessing the impact of control measures proved to be difficult without more accurate data. In conclusion, this study provides us a useful tool at district level for public health, and illustrates the importance of collecting and sharing data.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1371/journal.pone.0147172"

In areas where access to safe water and sanitation are limited, oral cholera vaccine (OCV) can save lives. Establishment of a global stockpile for OCV reflects increasing priority for use of cholera vaccines in endemic settings. Community acceptance of vaccines, however, is critical and sociocultural features of acceptance require attention for effective implementation. This study identifies and compares sociocultural determinants of anticipated OCV acceptance across populations in Southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Western Kenya and Zanzibar.METHODS: Cross-sectional studies were conducted using similar but locally-adapted semistructured interviews among 1095 respondents in three African settings. Logistic regression models identified sociocultural determinants of OCV acceptance from these studies in endemic areas of Southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (SE-DRC), Western Kenya (W-Kenya) and Zanzibar. Meta-analytic techniques highlighted common and distinctive determinants in the three settings.RESULTS: Anticipated OCV acceptance was high in all settings. More than 93% of community respondents overall indicated interest in a no-cost vaccine. Higher anticipated acceptance was observed in areas with less access to public health facilities. In all settings awareness of cholera prevention methods (safe food consumption and garbage disposal) and relating ingestion to cholera causation were associated with greater acceptance. Higher age, larger households, lack of education, social vulnerability and knowledge of oral rehydration solution for self-treatment were negatively associated with anticipated OCV acceptance. Setting-specific determinants of acceptance included reporting a reliable income (W-Kenya and Zanzibar, not SE-DRC). In SE-DRC, intention to purchase an OCV appeared unrelated to ability to pay. Rural residents were less likely than urban counterparts to accept an OCV in W-Kenya, but more likely in Zanzibar. Prayer as a form of self-treatment was associated with vaccine acceptance in SE-DRC and W-Kenya, but not in Zanzibar.CONCLUSIONS: These cholera-endemic African communities are especially interested in no-cost OCVs. Health education and attention to local social and cultural features of cholera and vaccines would likely increase vaccine coverage. High demand and absence of insurmountable sociocultural barriers to vaccination with OCVs indicate potential for mass vaccination in planning for comprehensive control or elimination.","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1186/s12889-016-2710-0"
